            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as this labour in that reſpecte deſerueth leſſe thanke, ſo for my parte it ought leſſe to be blamed. If ought be fownde amyſſe, the blame thereof rightly diuided betwen my frendes and me, the greater por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall redownde to them, the leſſer to me, as on whom the ſpotte of vnskille only ſhall cleaue, but the note of vndiſcretion ſhall remaine to them. For as the defectes be myne and none others, ſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of ſetting forth that, which was of leſſe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie,
<pb facs="tcp:3911:3"/> is to be imputed to them, not to me. How ſo euer it be, the meaning of vs bothe is only this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten reader, hereby to miniſter vnto thee, matter of comforte in theſe ſorowful, of ſtaye in theſe waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, of vnderſtanding the truth, in theſe erroneouſe times: withall, to call him backe, who in denying theſe articles, hath ouerrunne him ſelfe. Wherein I am not all together voyde of hope. Oure lord graunt, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of hereſie, pride, ſtoutenes of hart in gaineſaying, eſtimation of him ſelfe, and regarde of this world, ſtoppe not from him the holy ghoſtes working. Would god he maye weigh this my dooing ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, as my meaning towardes him is right, holeſom, and frendly. But in caſe that deepe woonde may not be cured with ſuch ſalue, yet my truſt is, it ſhall doo thee good, reader, who art either yet hole, or not ſo deſperatly woonded which if it doo, I ſhall thinke my labour well requitted, and my ſelfe to haue acheued that reward, which I ſought.</p>
            <p>Now this much I haue thought good here to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the of, that where as at the firſt, I appointed this to my priuate frend only, and not to all in common, (though in ſundry places I folow the maner of ſuch as mynde to publiſh their writinges) I haue ſo both or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the matter and tempered the ſtyle, as I iudge it might haue ben liked of my frend at home, and doubte whether it may beare the light abroade. I ſee mennes ſtomakes of oure time to be very delicate and diuerſe. Some require ſwete iunkettes, ſome ſower and ſharpe ſawces, ſome eſteme the curioſitie of coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerye, more then the holeſomnes of viandes, ſome
<pb facs="tcp:3911:3"/> can like no diſhe, be it neuer ſo well dighte. In this diuerſitie no man can pleaſe all. Who ſo euer ſeeketh it, ſhal fynde him ſelfe deceiued. I wene the beſt waye is, if a man herein mynde to doo ought, to make his prouiſion of the thinges only, wich be holeſome. So ſhal he diſpleaſe many, hurte none, and pleaſe al the good. Who ſo euer in doing this directeth his who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le purpoſe and endeuour to this ende, that he may profite and helpe all: in my iudgement, he doth the dutie of an honeſt and a good man. Verely in this treatiſe this hath ben myne onely purpoſe, and the meane to bring the ſame to effecte, hath ben ſuch, as whereby I ſtudied to profite holeſomely, not to pleaſe delicately. How much good I haue performed, I know not, my conſcience (which is ynough) beareth me witnes of good will. What the Apoſtles haue pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in this great barrayneſſe and drowth of faith, I haue deſyred againe to water. God geue encreace.</p>
            <p>If the multitude of allegations brought for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of ſome theſe Articles, ſhal ſeme tediouſe, no merueile. I ſhuld miſlike the ſame in an other my ſelfe. I graunt herein I haue not alwayes kepte due com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes. For ſymply to ſaye, what I thinke (hauing leaue to retourne to my former metaphore) ſoothly in ſome courſes, I haue ouer charged the borde with diſshes. Merueile not, I haue done that, I diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend my ſelfe, to auoyde a more reproufe in greater reſpecte, I haue wittingly done a thing, in ſome degree reprouea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Neither thinke I greatly to offende, if in this time of ſpirituall famine, I folow the woont of ſome feaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers. who of their neighbours twited with nyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardnes,
<pb facs="tcp:3911:4"/> to ſhewe their largeſſe and bountie, feaſte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with lauiſhe. The aduerſarie, as here thou mayſt ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath not ſpared to irke vs with reproche of penurie, of ſcarcitie, of lacked meane of proufes for maintenance of ſome good parte of oure religion. In this caſe to me it ſemed a parte of iuſt defence, to vtter ſome good ſtore. And the nyggardes feaſte by olde prouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be is well commended, thou knoweſt pardie. Neither yet haue we empted all our ſpence, as hereafter it ſhal appeare, if nede require.</p>
            <p>If ſome doo not alowe this conſideration, who ſo euer the ſame ſhall blame, him here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluding, ſhortly I anſwere with Alexander king of Macedons. who to Leonidas one of his Mynnions fynding faute with ſpending much frankencenſe in ſacrifices, wrote thus in fewe.

For whereas you require but one ſentence for the auouching of any one of them all: the more groweth your number, the more enlarged is the libertie of the anſwerer. It ſemeth you haue conceiued a great confidence in the cauſe, and that your aduerſaries (ſo it liketh you to terme vs whom God hath ſo ſtayde with his grace as we can not beare you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie in departing from his catholike churche) haue litle or nothing to ſaye in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.

What, feared you reproche of daſtardnes, if you had called forth no more but one learned ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all your aduerſaries, and therefore to ſhew your hardyneſſe, added more weight of wordes to your proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and chalenged all the learned men that be a lyue?<note place="margin">In the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fol. 46</note>

            <p>Among cowardes perhappes it ſerueth the tourne ſome tymes, to looke fiercely, to ſpeake terribly, to ſhake the weapon furiouſly, to threaten bloudily, no leſſe then cutting, hewing and killing but amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:3911:10"/> we ſee many tymes ſore frayes foughten, and neuer a blowe geuen. With ſuch bragges of him ſelf, and reproche of all others, Homer the wiſeſt of all poetes ſetteth forth Therſites, for the fondeſt man of all the Grecians, that came to Troye. Goliath the giaunt ſo ſtoute as he was, made offer to fight but with one Iſraelite.<note place="margin">1. Reg. 17. Eligite ex vobis vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendat ad ſingulare certamen.</note> Chooſe out a man amongſt you (quoth he) and let him come and fight with me man for man. But you Maiſter Iuell in this quarell, aſke not the combate of one catholike man only, but as one ſuer of the victory before proufe of fight, caſt your gloue as it were, and with ſtraunge defyaunce, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke all learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be a lyue to campe with you.</p>
            <p>Now if this matter ſhall ſo fall out, as thouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe appeare euidently on our ſyde, and the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on youres, that is to witte, if we can not bring one ſentence for proufe of any one of all theſe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, out of the ſcriptures, auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t councelles, doctours, or example of the primitiue churche: yet wiſe and graue men, I ſuppoſe, would haue lyked you better, if you had meekely and ſoberly reported the truth. For truth as it is playne and ſimple, ſo it needeth not to be ſet forth with bragge of high wordes. You remember that old ſaying of the wiſe, <hi>Simplex verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis oratio.</hi> the vtteraunce of truth ought to be ſimple.</p>
            <p>But if the victory (loth I am to vſe this inſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t word were it not to folow the metaphore which your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge hath dryuen me vnto) fall to our ſyde, that is to ſaye, if we ſhalle be hable to alleage ſome one ſufficient ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for proufe of ſome one of all theſe articles: yea if we ſhall be hable to alleage diuerſe and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3911:10"/> ſundry ſentences places and authorities for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of ſundry theſe articles: In this caſe I wene, you ſhall hardly eſcape amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſober me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the reproche of raſhnes, among humble men, of preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, among godly men, of wickednes.

Of wickednes, for what is more wicked, then (the former caſe ſtanding) ſo to remoue the hartes of the people from deuotion, ſo to bring the churche in to contempte, ſo to ſet at nought the ordinances of the holy ghoſt?</p>
            <p>As you folow the new and ſtraunge doctrine of Theodorus Beza and Peter Martyr, the prolocutours of the Caluinian churches in Fraunce, whoſe ſcolar a long tyme you haue ben: ſo you diuerte farre from that prudencie, ſobrietie, and modeſtie, which in their owtward demeanour, they ſhewed in that ſolemne and honorable aſſemble at Poyſsi in September 1561. as it appareth by the oration which Beza pronunced there in the name of all the Caluiniſtes. In which oration with humble and often proteſtation, they ſubmitte them ſelues, if cauſe ſhall ſo appeare, to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aduiſe and iudgement, as thoug they might be deceiued, vttering theſe and the like wordes in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places. If we be deceiued, we would be gladde to
<pb facs="tcp:3911:11"/> know it.] Item, [For the ſmall meaſure of knowledge that it hath pleaſed God to impart vnto vs, it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that this tranſubſtantiation, etc.] Item, [if we be not deceiued,] Item, [In caſe we be deciued, we would be gladde to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it, etc.] But you Maiſter Iuell, as though you had readde all that euer hath ben writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in theſe pointes, and had borne a waye all that euer-hath ben taught, and were ignorant of nothing tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſame: and none other beſyde you had ſene ought, and were hable to ſaye ought: ſaye meruelouſe confidently, and that in the moſt honorable and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent audience of this Realme, that you are well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that none of your learned aduerſaries, no nore all the learned men a lyue, ſhall euer be hable to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage one ſentence for any one of theſe Articles,<note place="margin">In the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fol. 49</note> and that becauſe you know it, therefor you ſpeake it, leaſt happely your hearers ſhuld be deceiued.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe in your anſwere to Doctour Coles firſt letter, you ſaye, ſpeaking of theſe Articles, you thought it beſt to make your entre in your preaching with ſuch thinges,<note place="margin">Fol 6.</note> as where in you were well aſſured, we ſhuld be hable to fynde not ſo much as any colour or ſhadow of Doctours at all. Where in you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw your ſelf from plaineneſſe, ſo much as you doo in your preſumptuouſe chalenge, from modeſtie. For being demaunded of D.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3911:11"/> ſacrifice of the Maſſe, and of ſuch other: not vnwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting how much and how ſufficient authoritie maye be brought againſt your ſyde for proufe of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike doctrine there in, leaſt all the world ſhuld eſpye your weakenes in theſe pointes, you anſwer, that you thought it better to begynne with ſmaller matters, as theſe Articles be, becauſe you aſſure your ſelf, we haue nothing for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation of them. Thus craftely you ſhifte your handes of thoſe greater pointes, wherin you know ſcriptures, councelles, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, and examples of the primitiue churche to be of our ſyde, and caſt vnto vs, as a bone to gnaw vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, this number of Articles of leſſe weight, a fewe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, to occupie vs withall. Which be partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning order, rather then doctrine, and partly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queles of former and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed truthes, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall pointes of faith, in th'exact treatie of which, the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t doctours of the churche haue not imployed their ſtudie and trauaile of writing. For many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being ſequeles depending of a confeſſed truth, they thought it needeleſſe to treate of them. For as much as a principall point of truth graunted, the graunting of all the neceſſarie ſequeles is implyed. As in a chayne,<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Gregoriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fratrem.</note> (which compariſon S. Baſile maketh in the like caſe) he that draweth the firſt lynk after him, draweth alſo the laſt lynke. And for this cauſe in dede the leſſe number and weight of ſuch auncient auctorities may be brought for th'auouching of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And yet the thinges in them expreſſed be not iuſtly improued by any clauſe or ſentence, you haue ſayde or vttered hytherto.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3911:12"/>
            <p>Verely M. Iuell if you had not be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more deſyrouſe to deface the catholike churche, then to ſet forth the truth: you would neuer haue rehearced ſuch a long rolle of articles, which for the more part be of leſſe importance: whereby you go about to diſcredite vs, and to make the world beleue, we haue nothing to ſhew for vs in a great part of our Religion, and that you be to be taken for zelouſe men, right reformers of the churche, and vndoubted reſtorers of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. As touching the other weighty pointes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reupon almoſt only your ſcoolemaiſters of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, Suityerland and Geneua, bothe in their preachin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and alſo in their writinges treate, you will not yet aduenture the triall of them with making your matche with learned men, and in the meane tyme ſet them forth by ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s buſyly among the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſimple people, vntill ſuch tyme, as you haue wonne your purpoſe in theſe ſmaller matters.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſeme to folow a ſleight, which king Alexander the great vſed, to further the courſe of his conqueſtes.<note place="margin">In vita Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dri Magni.</note> Who as Plutarche writeth, where as he thought verely, that he was begoten of a God, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed him ſelf toward the Barbarians very haute and proude. Yet among the Grekes he vſed a more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie, and ſpake litle of his godhead. For they being rude and of ſmall vnderſtanding, he doubted not but by wayes and meanes to bring them to ſuch beleue. But the Grekes, whom he knew to be men of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent knowledge and learning, of them he iudged, as it proued in dede, the matter ſhuld be more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyly ſkanned, then ſymply beleued. Right ſo you
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3911:12"/> M. Iuell perſuading your ſelf to haue ſingular ſkille in diuinitie, among the ſimple people you vtter the weighty and high pointes of Chriſten Religion that be now in queſtion, in ſuch wiſe, as the proteſtantes haue written of them, and with vehement affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with miſconſtrewed and falſefied allegations, and with pitifull exclamations, you leade the ſeely ſoules in to dangerouſe errours. But in your wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges, which you knew ſhuld paſſe the iudgement of learned men, the pointes of greater importaunce you coouer with ſilence, and vtter a number of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of leſſe weight for the more part in reſpect of the chiefe, though for good cauſe receiued and vſed in the churche, (I ſpeake of them as they be rightly taken) denying them all, and requyring the catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes your aduerſaries to prooue them. Where in you ſhew your ſelf not to feare controlment of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but to miſtruſt the triall of the learned.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe in the holy Canon of the Maſſe you fynde faultes, where none are, as it may eaſely be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, thinking for defence thereof, we had litle to ſaye. But of the prayer there made to the virgine Mary, the Apoſtles and martyrs, of the ſuffrages for the departed in the faith of Chriſt: in your whole booke you vtter neuer a worde, though you miſlike it, and otherwheres ſpeake againſt it, as all your ſecte doth. And why? Forſooth becauſe you know right well, we haue ſtore of good authorities for proufe thereof. And by your will, you will not yet ſtryue with vs in matters, wherein by the iudgement of the people, to whom you lene much, you ſhuld ſeme
<pb facs="tcp:3911:13"/> ouermatched. And therefore you ſerch out ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in compariſon of the greateſt, ſuch as the old doctours haue paſſed ouer with ſilence, and for that can not of our part by aunciet authorities be ſo am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply affirmed, at leaſt waye as you thinke your ſelf aſſured. And in this reſpecte you laye on lode of blame, contumelies and ſclaunders vpon the churche, for mainteining of them. Where in the marke you ſhoote at, euery man perceiueth what it is euen that when you haue brought the catholike churche in to contempte, and borne the people in hand, we are not hable to proue a number of thinges by you denyed, for lacke of ſuch proufes, as your ſelf ſhall allow, in certaine particular pointes of ſmall force (which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely you report to be the greateſt keys and higheſt myſteries of our Religion): then triumphing againſt vs and deſpyſing the auncient and catholike Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in general, you may ſet vp a new Religion of your own forging; a new church of your own framing, a new goſpell of your own deuiſe. Well may I further ſaye, <hi>cathedram contra cathedram,</hi> but not I trowe, as S. Auguſtine termeth ſuch ſtate of Religion; <hi>altare contrâ alture.</hi> For what ſo euer ye ſet vp, if ye ſet vp any thing at all, and pull not downe onlye all maner of aulters muſt nedes be throwen downe.</p>
            <p>Now being ſorye to ſee the catholike churche by your ſtoute and bolde bragges thus attempted to be defaced, the truth in maner outfaced, and the ſeely people ſo dangerouſly ſeduced: Imbarred of libertie to preache by Recogniſance, and yet not ſo diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in conſcience of dutie apperteyning to my cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3911:13"/> I haue now thought good to ſet forth this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe in writing, whereby to my power to ſaue the honour of the churche, which is our common mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to defend the truth in whoſe quarell none ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture is to be refuſed, and to reduce the people from deceite and errour, which by order of charitie we are bownde vnto.</p>
            <p>For the doing here of if you be offended, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of good and right meaning ſhal ſone eaſe me of that griefe. Verely myne intent was not to hurt you, but to profite you, by declaring vnto you that truth, which you ſeme hytherto not to haue knowen. For if you had, I wene you would not haue preached and written, as you haue. Your yeres, your maner of ſtudie, and the partie you haue ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned your ſelf vnto conſydered, it may well be thought you haue not thoroughly ſene, how much may be ſayde in defence of the catholike doctrine touching theſe Articles, which you haue denyed.</p>
            <p>For the maner of doing, I am verely perſuaded, that neither you, nor any of your felowes, which of all theſe new ſectes by your ſyde profeſſed, ſo euer he lyketh beſt, ſhall haue iuſt cauſe to complaine. The whole treatiſe is written with out choler, with out gaull, with out ſpite. What I miſlike in you, and in them of your ſyde, I could not allow in my ſelf. Where truthes cauſe is treated, humaine affections, where by the cleare light is dymmed, ought to be layd a parte. Glykes, nyppes and ſcoffes, bittes, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and gyrdes, become not that ſtage. Yet if I ſhall perhappes ſometymes ſeme to ſcarre or lawnce a
<pb facs="tcp:3911:14"/> feſtered bunche, that deſerueth to be cut of, you will remember I doubte not, how the meekeſt and the holyeſt of the auncient fathers in reprouing hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, oftery m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Whoſe taſte ſo euer lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth moſt after ſuch ſawce, in this treatiſe he ſhall fynde ſmall lyking. For it is occupyed more about the fortifying of the Articles denyed, then about diſprouing of the perſon, who hath denyed them. Wherein I haue ſome deale fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the latter parte of Chilo the wiſe man his counſaile, which I allow better then the firſt. <hi>Ama, tanquam oſurus, oderis, tanquam amaturus.</hi> loue, as to hate, hate, as to loue.</p>
            <p>If any man that ſhall reade this, be of that humour, as ſhall miſlike it, as being colde, lowe, flatte and dull, and requyre rather ſuch verder of writing, as is hote, lofty, ſharp and quycke, which pleaſeth beſt the taſt of our tyme: vnderſtand he, that before I intended to put this forth in printe, I thus tempered my ſtile for theſe conſyderations. Firſt, where as a certaine exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of a learned man of fiue or ſix ſheetes of paper ſpredde abroade in the Realme in defence of ſome of theſe Articles by M. Iuell denyed, was fathered vpon me, which in dede I neuer made ſentence of, and therefore a ſtorme imminent was myſtruſted: that by chaunging the hew, which many know me by, that know me familiarly, in caſe it ſhuld come to the handes of many, as it was likely, I myght eſcape the danger of being charged with it, and neuer the leſſe ſatisfye my frendes requeſt, and in ſome parte
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3911:14"/> alſo my conſcience, and doo good. Secondly, that I thought meeke, ſober and cold demeanour of writing to be moſt ſitting for ſuch kynde of argument.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and ſpecially that my hart ſerued me not to deale with M. Iuell myne old acquainted, felow and countreyman other wiſe, then ſwetly, gentilly and courteouſlye. And in dede here I proteſt, that I loue M. Iuell, and deteſt his hereſies.</p>
            <p>And now Syr, as I loue you, right ſo I am deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſe of your ſoule helth, which you ſeme either to forgete, or to ꝓcure by a wrong waye. Bethinke your ſelf I praye you, whether the waye you walke in, be not the ſame, and you the man, that Salomon moued with the ſpirite of God, ſpeaketh of. There is a waye,<note place="margin">Prouer. 26</note> that ſemeth to a man right, and the ende of it lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to damnation. Certaine it is, you are deceiued, and maineteine vntruth, as it ſhall appeare by this treatiſe. Here in you ſuſteine the euill of humaine infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie. Mary, when deceite is by plaine truth detected, then to dwell and continewe in errour, that proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not of humaine weakenes, but of deuiliſh ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie. But you M. Iuell as many men thinke, and I truſt, are not yet ſwallowed vp of that gulfe. Fayne would I doo you good, if I wiſt how. I feare me your ſore is putrifyed ſo farre, as oyle and lenitiues wil not ſerue now, but rather vinegre and coroſiues. You remember I doubte not, what Cicero ſayth. that medicine to profite moſt, which cauſeth the greateſt ſmarte, And what Salomon alſo,<note place="margin">Prouer. 27</note> The woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of à frend, to be better then the kiſſes of an enemie.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3911:15"/>
            <p>The beſt ſalue any man can miniſter vnto you, verely I thinke, is, to exhorte you to humilitie, and to denying of your ſelfe. For if you could be brought to humble your ſelfe, and to denye your ſelfe, doubtles you ſhuld ſee in your ſelfe, that you ſee not.

For no man offereth that dredfull Sacrifice priuately for him ſelfe alone, but for the whole Churche of Chriſt in common. The Communion li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewiſe of the Sacrament, is a publike feaſt by Chriſt through the miniſterie of the prieſt in the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for euery faithfull perſon: from partaking whereof none is excluded, that with due examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hauing before made him ſelfe ready, demaundeth the ſame. And ſo being common by order of the firſt Inſtitution, and by will of the miniſters, it ought to
<pb facs="tcp:3911:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> be reputed for common, not priuate.</p>
               <p>That others doo ſo commonly forebeare to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the prieſt, it is through their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulte and negligence, not regarding their owne ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <pb facs="tcp:3911:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>As for the other doctoures of the churche, that fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Apoſtles and thoſe Apoſtolike me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, many in number, excellent in learning, holy of lyfe, to ſhew what may be brought out of their workes for proufe of this matter, that th'oblation of the body and bloude of Chriſt in the Maſſe is the ſacrifice of the Church, and proper to the new teſtament, it would require a whole volume: and therefore not being moued by M. Iuelles Chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge to ſpeake ſpecially ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but as it is priuate after their meaning, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good treatiſes in defence of this ſacrifice being ſet forth already in printe: at this preſent, I will ſaye no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, thinking hereof, as Saluſt dyd of Carthago that great citie, that it were better to kepe ſilence, then to ſpeake fewe.</p>
               <p>Now this preſuppoſed, that the Maſſe ſtandeth vpon good and ſufficient groundes for the ſtay of all true chriſten mennes beleefe: let vs come to our ſpeciall pourpoſe, and ſaye ſomewhat of priuate Maſſe, as our aduerſaries call it.</p>
               <p>The chiefe cauſe why they ſtorme ſo much againſt priuate Maſſe, is, for that the prieſt receiueth the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament alone: which thing they expreſſe with great vilanie of wordes. Now in caſe the people might be ſtyrred to ſuch deuotion, as to diſpoſe them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues worthely to receiue their houſell euery daye with the prieſt, as they dyd in the primitiue church, when they looked hourely to be caught and done to death in the perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Paynimes, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted not hence, <hi>Sine Viatico,</hi> without their viage prouiſion: what ſhuld theſe men haue to ſaye? In this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3911:20"/> caſe perhappes they would fynde other defaultes in the Maſſe, but againſt it in this reſpect onely that it is priuate, they ſhuld haue nothing to ſaye at all. So the right of their cauſe depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth of the miſdooing of the people, which if they would amende, theſe folke ſhuld be dryuen either to recant, or to holde their peace. To other defaultes of the Maſſe by them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truely ſurmyſed, anſwere ſhal be made hereafter. Now touching this.</p>
               <p>Where no defaulte is committed, there no blame is to be imputed. That oftentymes the prieſt at Maſſe hath no comparteners to receiue the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with him, it procedeth of lacke of deuotion of the peoples parte, not of enuye or malice of his parte.</p>
               <p>The feaſte is common, all be inuited, they may come that lyſt, they ſhall be receiued that be diſpoſed and proued: None is thruſt awaye, that thus commeth: it may be obtruded to none viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, ne offred to none raſhely. Well, none commeth. This is not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe, why the faithfull and godly prieſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with the loue of God, feeling him ſelfe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and thirſty after that heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly foode and drynke, ſhuld be kepte from it, and imbarred from celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the memoire of our lordes death according to his commaundement, from his dutie of geuing than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes for that great benefite, from taking the cuppe of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and calling vpon the name of God:<note place="margin">Pſal. 115.</note> for theſe thinges be done in the Maſſe.</p>
               <p>But the enemies of this holy ſacrifice ſaye, that this is againſt the Inſtitution of Chriſt. God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bydde, the Inſtitution of Chriſt ſhuld not be kepte.
<pb facs="tcp:3911:21" rendition="simple:additions"/> But it is a world to ſee, how they crye out for the Inſtitution of Chriſt, by whom it is moſt wickedly broken. For where as in Chriſtes Inſtitution concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this Sacrament, three thinges are conteined, which he him ſelfe dyd, and by his commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t gaue auctoritie to the Church to doo the ſame, the Conſecration,<note place="margin">Three eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials of the Maſſe.</note> the oblation, and the participation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein conſiſteth the ſubſtance of the Maſſe: they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing quite aborogated the other two, and not ſo much as once naming them in their bookes of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, now haue lefte to the people nothing but a bare Communion, and that after their own ſorte: with what face can they ſo buſely crye for Chriſtes Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, by whom in the chiefe pointes the ſame is violated?</p>
               <p>Of Conſecration and Oblation although much might be ſayde here againſt them, I will at this tyme ſaye nothing. Concerning participation the number of communicantes together in one place that they iangle ſo much of, as a thing ſo neceſſary, that with out it, the Maſſe is to be reputed vnlaufull: is no parte of Chriſtes Inſtitution. For Chriſt ordeined the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, after conſecration and oblation done, to be receiued and eaten. And for that ende he ſayd: <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Number of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants, place, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, vvith other ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, bee not of Chriſtes inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Now as for the number of the communicantes, how many ſhuld receiue together in one place, and in what place, what tyme, ſitting at table (as ſome would haue it) ſtanding or kneeling, faſting, or after other meates: and whether they ſhuld receiue it in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3911:21"/> their handes, or with their mowthes, and other the like orders, maners and circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces: all theſe thinges perteine to the ceremonie of eating. the obſeruation whereof dependeth of the churches ordinance, and not of Chriſtes Inſtitution. And therefore S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine writing to Ianuarius ſayeth: <hi>Saluator non praecepit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. 118.</note> 
                  <hi>quo deinceps ordine ſumeretur, vt Apoſtolis, per quos diſpoſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus erat Eccleſiam, ſeruaret hunc locum.</hi> Our Sauiour gaue not commaundement in what order it ſhuld be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, meaning to reſerue that matter to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, by whom he would directe and diſpoſe his churche. Wherefore the receiuing of the Sacrament being the Inſtitution of Chriſt, and the maner, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and other rites of the receiuing not fixed nor determined by the ſame, but ordered by the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches diſpoſition: whether many or fewe, or but one, in one place receiue: for that reſpecte the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the prieſt is not made vnlaufull.</p>
               <p>But if they alleage againſt vs the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Chriſt, ſaying that he receiued it not alone, but did commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with his twelue Apoſtles, and that we ought to folow the ſame: I anſwer, that we are bounde to folow this example, <hi>quo ad ſubſtantiam, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quo ad externam ceremoniam.</hi> for the ſubſtance, not for the outward ceremonie, to the which perteineth the number and other rites, as is a fore ſayde. Chriſtes exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth neceſsitie of receiuing onely, the other rites, as number, place, tyme etc. be of congruence and order. In which thinges the churche hath taken order, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and charging, that all ſhall communicate, that be worthy and diſpoſed. And ſo it were to be wiſhed,
<pb facs="tcp:3911:22" rendition="simple:additions"/> as oftentymes as the prieſt doth celebrate this high ſacrifice, that there were ſome, who worthely diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, might receiue their rightes with him, and be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tally of the body and bloude of Chriſt with him. But in caſe ſuch do lacke, as we haue ſene that lacke commonly in our tyme yet therefore the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall and dayly ſacrifice ought not to be intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For ſith this is done in remembraunce of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes oblation once made on the Croſſe for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of all mankinde, therefore it ought dayly to be celebrated thorough out the whole churche of Chriſt, for the better keping of that great benefite in remembraunce: and that though none receiue with the prieſt. And it is ſufficient in that caſe, if they that be preſent, be partakers of thoſe holy myſteries ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, and communicate with him in prayer and thankes geuing, in faith and deuotion, hauing their mynde and will to communicate with him alſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally, when tyme ſhall ſerue.</p>
               <p>M. Iuell and many other of that ſyde, thinke to haue an argument againſt priuate Maſſe, of the word <hi>Communio,</hi> as though the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t were called a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſyderation of many receiuers together. So he calleth that a Communion,<note place="margin">In his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. fo. 41.</note> which is for the whole congregation to receiue together. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his ſermon oftentymes he maketh an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition betwen priuate Maſſe and communion, and alleaging diuerſe places where mention is of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, inferreth of eche of them an argument againſt priuate Maſſe. But this argument is weake and vtterly vnlearned, as that which procedeth of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3911:22"/> For it is not ſo called, becauſe many,<note place="margin">Why the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is called a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> or as M.

And for that cauſe it is alonely called the communion. For albe it euery Sacrament be ſuch, as gathereth our lyues that be diuided a ſunder many wayes in to that one ſtate, whereby we are ioyned to God: yet the name of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion is fitte and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for this ſacrament ſpecially and peculiarly, more then for any other. By which wordes and by the whole place of that holy father, we vnderſtand, that this ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is ſpecially called the communion, for the ſpeciall effecte it worketh in vs, which is to ioyne vs nearely to God, ſo as we be in him, and he in vs, and all we that beleue in him, one body in
<pb facs="tcp:3911:23" rendition="simple:additions"/> Chriſt. And for this in dede we doo not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate alone. For in aſmuch as the whole churche of God is but one houſe,<note place="margin">De coena domini.</note> as Saint Cyprian ſayeth, <hi>Vna eſt domus eccleſiae, in qua agnus editur.</hi> There is one houſe of the church, wherein the lambe is eaten: and S.

                     </gap>.

And therefore S. Hierom a prieſt ſhewing him ſelfe loth to contend in writing with S. Auguſtine a biſhop, calleth him a biſhop of his communion.<note place="margin">Inter epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolas Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtini. epiſt. 14.</note> His wordes be theſe. <hi>Non enim conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit, vt ab adoleſcentia vſque ad hanc aetatem, in monaſteriolo cum ſanctis fratribus labore deſudans, aliquid contrà Epiſcopum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munionis meae ſcribere audeam, &amp; eum Epiſcopu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, quem ante coepi amare, quâm noſſe.</hi> It is not meete (ſayeth he) that I oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in labour from my yowth vntil this age, in a poore monaſterie with holy brethren, ſhuld be ſo bolde as to write any thing againſt a biſhop of my communion, yea and that biſhop, whom I beganne to loue, er that I knewe him. Thus we ſee, that S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom and S. Auguſtine were of one communion, and dyd comunicate together, though they were farre a ſunder, the one at Bethlehem in Paleſtina, the other at Hippo in Aphrica. Thus there may be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, though the communicantes be not together in one place. What if foure or fyue of ſundry houſes in a ſicknes tyme being at the pointe of death in a parriſh, requyre to haue their rightes er they departe? The prieſt after that he hath receiued the ſacrament
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3911:23"/> in the church, taketh his naturall ſuſtenaunce and dyneth. and then being called vpon, carieth the reſte a mile or two to the ſicke, in eche houſe none being diſpoſed to receiue with the ſicke, he doth that he is requyred. Doth he not in this caſe communicate with them, and doo not they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate one with an other, rather hauing a will to communicate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one place alſo, if oportunitie ſerued? Elles if this might not be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted as a lawfull and good communion, and therfore not to be vſed: th'one of theſe great inconueniences ſhuld wittingly be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. That either they ſhuld be denyed that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie vitayle of lyfe at their departing hence, which were a cruel iniurie, and a thing contrary to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and godly ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the primitiue churche: Or the prieſt rather for companies ſake then of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, ſhuld receiue that holy meate, after that he had ſerued his ſtomake with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon meates, which likewiſe is againſt the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t decrees of the churche.

               <p>That Chriſt might vnite euery one of vs within our ſelues, and with God, although we be diſtant both in body and alſo in ſoule, yet he hath deuiſed a meane conuenable to the counſell of the father, and to his own wiſedom. For in that he bleſſeth them that beleue, with his own body through the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Communion, he maketh vs one body both with him ſelfe, and alſo betwen our ſelues. For who will thinke them not to be of this natural vnion, which with the vnion of that one holy body, be vnited in one Chriſt? For if we eate all of one bread, then are we made all one body: for Chriſt may not be diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, nor done aſunder.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee after this auncient fathers learning grounded vpon the ſcriptures, that all the faithfulles bleſſed with the body of Chriſt through the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call communion, bee made one body with Chriſt, and one body betwen them ſelues. Which good bleſsing of Chriſt is of more vertue, and alſo of more neceſsitie, then that it may be made fruſtrate by

To God nothing is hydde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yea darknes alſo ſhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth before God. Let euery one examine him ſelfe, and ſo come to the body of Chriſt. S.

By this we may vndeſtand, that in the auncient tymes of the Churche, the receiuing of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3911:29"/> of one by ſelfe alone, was well allowed. And though it was done but by one faithfull perſon at once in one place, yet was it called a communion both of S. Baſile, and alſo of S. Hierom, cleane contrary to M. Iuelles ſenſe. It is to be iudged that they knew the Inſtitution of Chriſt, ſo well as he, or any other of theſe newe Maiſters, and that their conſcience was ſuch, as if Chriſtes ordinance therein had ben bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, they would not haue winckte at it, ne with their vngodly ſilence confirmed ſuch an vngodly cuſtome.

Which doubteles muſt be vndeſtanded of this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate and ſingle communion in eche catholike mans houſe, and that where heretikes bare the ſwea, and prieſtes might not be ſuffred to conſecrate after the catholike vſage.

               <p>Here haue I brought much for proufe of priuate and ſingle communion, and that it hath not onely ben ſuffered in tyme of perſecution, but alſo allowed in quiet and peaceable tymes, euen in the Churche of Rome it ſelfe, where true Religion hath euer ben moſt exactly obſerued aboue all other places of the worlde, and from whence all the churches of the Weſt hath taken their light.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3911:30"/> viage prouiſion, alone: But I iudge this is ynough, and if any man will not be perſuaded with this, I doubte whether with ſuch a one a more number of autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhall any thing priuaile.</p>
               <p>Now that I haue thus proued the ſingle commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I vſe their own terme, I deſire M. Iuell to reaſon with me ſoberly a word or two. How ſaye you Syr? doo you reproue the Maſſe, or doo you reproue the priuate Maſſe? I thinke what ſo euer your opinion is herein, your anſwer ſhall be, you allow not the priuate Maſſe. For as touching that the Oblation of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloude of Chriſt done in the Maſſe, is the ſacrifice of the churche, and proper to the new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, commaunded by Chriſt to be frequented ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his inſtitution: if you denye this, make it ſo light as you liſte: all thoſe authorities, which you denye vs to haue for proufe of your great number of articles, will be fownde againſt you: I meane do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoures, general councelles the moſt auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, th'exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the primitiue churche, the ſcriptures, I adde further reaſon, conſent vniuerſall and vncontrolled, and tradition. If you denye this, you muſt denye all our Religion from the Apoſtles tyme to this daye, and now in the ende of the world, when iniquitie abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, and charitie waxeth colde, when the ſonne of man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming ſhall ſcarcely finde faith in the earth, begynne a new. And therefore you M. Iuell knowing this well ynough, what ſo euer you doo in dede, in worde, as it appeareth by the litle booke you haue ſet foorth in printe: you pretende to diſallow, yea moſt veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to improue the priuate Maſſe. Vpon
<pb facs="tcp:3911:31" rendition="simple:additions"/> this reſolution, that the Maſſe, as it is taken in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, is to be allowed: I enter further in reaſon with you, and make you this argument. If priuate Maſſe in reſpecte only of that it is priuate after your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, be reproueable, it is for the ſingle communion, that is to ſaye, for that the prieſt receiueth the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alone. But the ſingle communion is laufull, yea good and godly: ergo the priuate Maſſe in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecte that it is priuate, is not reproueable, but to be allowed, holden for good and holy, and to be freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. If you denye the firſt propoſition, or maior, then muſt youe ſhew for what elles you doo reproue pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Maſſe in reſpecte only that it is priuate, then for ſingle communion. If you ſhew any thing elles, then doo you digreſſe from our purpoſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that you reproue the Maſſe. The minor you can not denye, ſeing that you ſee how ſufficiently I haue proued it. And ſo the priuate Maſſe in that reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecte only it is priuate, is to be allowed for good, as the Maſſe is. Mary I denye not but that it were more comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dable, and more godly on the churches parte, if many wel diſpoſed and examined, would be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the bleſſed Sacrament with the prieſt. But though the Clergie be worthely blamed for negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence herein, through which the people may be thought to haue growen to this ſlaknes and indeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion: yet that notwithſtanding, this parte of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Religion remaineth ſownde and faultles. For as touching the ſubſtance of the Maſſe it ſelfe, by the ſingle communion of the prieſt, in caſe of the peoples coldenes and negligence, it is nothing impaired. Elles
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3911:31"/> if the publike ſacrifice of the churche might not be offered with out a number of communicantes recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing with the prieſt in one place: then would the auncient fathers in all their writinges ſome where haue complained of the ceaſing of that, which eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where they call <hi>quotidianum &amp; iuge ſacrificium,</hi> the dayly and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall ſacrifice: of which their opinion is, that it ought dayly to be ſacrificed, that the death of our lord and the worke of our Rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption might alwayes be celebrated and had in memorie, and we thereby ſhewe our ſelues according to our bounden duetie myndefull and thankefull. But verely the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers no where complaine of intermitting the daily ſacrifice, but very much of the ſlaknes of the people, for that they came not more often vnto this holy and holeſome banket: and yet they neuer compelled them thereto, but exhorting them to freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely, lefte them to their owne conſcience.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3911:32"/> Therefore this that I ſpeake, is to all, not to them onely that be here preſent, but to thoſe alſo that lyue in wildernes. For they receiue the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t but once in the yere, and peraduenture but once in two yeres. Well what then? whom ſhall we receiue? thoſe that come but once, or that come often, or that come ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? Soothly we receiue them that come with a pure and a cleane conſcience, with a cleane harte, and to be ſhorte, with a blameleſſe lyfe. They that be ſuch, let them come allwayes, and they that be not ſuch, let not them come not ſo much as once. Why ſo? becauſe they receiue to them ſelues iudgement, damnation, and puniſhement.

               <p>Now let vs ſee what examples of the olde fathers we haue for the priuate Maſſe. <hi>Leontius</hi> a Greke biſhop of a Cirie in the Eaſt Churche called <hi>Neapolis,</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the lyfe of Saint Iohn the holy Patriarke of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who for his great charitie was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly called <hi>eleemoſynarius,</hi> that is, th'almoſe geuer, telleth this ſtory, whereby it appeareth that at that tyme priuate Maſſe was vſed. Though the tranſlatour through ignorance of the tyme he lyued in, tourned this lyfe in to latine of meane eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, yet for truthes ſake, I will not let to recite that, which I take for my purpoſe, as I fynde it. <hi>Malitiam reſeruantem quendam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrium contra alium principem, audiens hic Magnus Ioan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, monuit eum ſaepè, &amp; ſuaſit ad concordiam, &amp; non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit eum conuertere ad pacem. Semel ergo ad eum mittit &amp; adducit eum ſanctus, quaſi pro republica, &amp; facit miſſas in oratorio ſuo, nullum habens ſecum niſi miniſtrum ſuum. Cum ergo ſancta benedixiſſet Patriarcha, &amp; orationem Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam inchoaſſet, coeperu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t dicere tantum tres illi, Pater noſter, Et cum perueniſſent ad ſermonem quo dicitur, Dimitte nobis debita noſtra, ſicut &amp; nos dimittimus debitoribus noſtris: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuit domeſtico Patriarcha, vt taceret. Siluit ergo &amp; Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archa, &amp; remanſit Princeps ſolus dicens verſum, dimitte no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis, ſicut &amp; nos dimittimus. Et ſtatim conuerſus ſanctus, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit ei manſueta voce. Vide in quàm terribili voce dicas Deo, quoniam ſicut ego dimitto, ita &amp; tu dimitte mihi. Et tanqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ab igne statim cruciatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ferens praedictus princeps, cecidit in faciem ad pedes ſancti, dicens: Quaecunque iuſſeris domine, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faciet ſeruus tuus. Et reconciliatus eſt inimico ſuo cum omni veritate.</hi> This ſtory ſoundeth thus in Engliſh. This great patriarke Iohn, hearing that a noble man bare
<pb facs="tcp:3911:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> malice to an other noble man, warned him often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes of it, and treated with him, to be at accorde, but he could not bring him to be at peace. Wherefore on a daye this holy father ſent for the noble man, and cauſeth him to come to him, as though it were about ſome matter of the common weale. At that tyme he ſayeth Maſſe in his chappell, hauing none other body with him, but his ſeruant. When the Patriarke had conſecrated the ſacrament, and had begonne to ſaye our lordes prayer, they three onely begonne to ſaye <hi>Our father,</hi> and ſo foorth. When they were come to thoſe wordes, <hi>Forgeue vs our treſpaſſes, as we forgeue them, that treſpaſſe against vs:</hi> the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arke made a becke to his ſeruant, to holde his peace. then the Patriarke held his peace alſo. and the noble man remained alone, ſaying foorth the verſe, <hi>Forgeue vs, as we forgeue:</hi> Then the holy father tourning him ſelfe toward him, by and by ſayeth with a milde voice. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider with how terrible wordes thou ſayeſt to God, that as I forgeue, ſo ſorgeue thou me alſo. Whereat the ſayde noble man, as though he had felt the torment of fyer, foorth with fell downe on his face at the holy fathers feete, ſaying: My lord, what ſo euer thou byddeſt me thy ſeruant to doo, I will doo it. And ſo he was reconciled vnto his enemie, with out all diſſembling.</p>
               <p>Here M. Iuell I trowe, will grawnt that this was a priuate Maſſe. The place was priuate, the audie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce not publike nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, the purpoſe touching the noble man, was priuate: The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion alſo priuate, I meane for the patriarkes parte alone, for beſyde that the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3911:36"/> ſtory maketh no mention of any other communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantes, he could not be aſſured of that noble man to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with him. For whereas he could by no meanes before bring him to forgeue his enemie, he had but a ſmall coniecture he ſhuld bring it to paſſe now. And agayne though he had conceiued no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt of his reconciliation vpon this holy policie, yet we may doubte, whether the patriarke foorth with, with out further and more mature probation and examination, which <hi>Saint Paul</hi> in this caſe requireth:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> would haue admitted him to receiue our lordes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſo vpon the ſuddeine. Now for the ſeruant, it is a ſtreight caſe that ſo holy and ſo great a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triake and biſhop of ſo populouſe a citie, as <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> was, vnderſtanding that Maſſe can not be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated with out breach of Chriſtes Inſtitution (as M. Iuell holdeth opinion) excepte he haue a number to communicate with him in the ſame place: ſhuld haue none of his ſpiritual flocke with him at ſo weightie a matter of conſcience, but one onely, and him his owne houſhold ſeruant. He was not ſo ſimple as not to thinke, that the ſeruant might be letted from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing by ſome ſuddeine pange co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vpon him, or with ſome cogitation and conſcience of his owne vnworthines ſuddeinly comming to his mynde. If either this, or any other let had chaunced, in what caſe had the patriarke ben then? He had ben like, by M. Iuelles doctrine, to haue broken Chriſtes Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, through an others defecte, which were ſtraunge. But I iudge, that M. Iuell, who harpeth ſo many iarring argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes againſt
<pb facs="tcp:3911:37" rendition="simple:additions"/> priuate Maſſe vpon the very word <hi>Communion,</hi> will not allowe that for a good and lawfull communion, where there is but one onely to receiue with the prieſt. Verely it appeareth by his ſermon that all the people ought to receiue, or to be dryuen out of the churche. Now therefore to an other example of the priuate Maſſe.</p>

And for the thing that the ſtorie ſheweth, as much as for any other, of the ſame <hi>Amphilochius</hi> he is called, <hi>Coeleſtium virtutum collocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, &amp; angelicorum ordinum comminiſter,</hi> a talker toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the heauenly powers, and a felowe ſeruant with orders of Angelles. The ſtory is this. This holy biſhop Baſile beſoughte God in his prayers, he would geue him grace, wiſedom and vnderſtanding, ſo as he might offer the ſacrifice of Chriſtes bloude ſheding, <hi>proprijs ſermonibus,</hi> with prayers and ſeruice of his owne making: and that the better to atcheue that purpoſe, the holy ghoſt might come vpon him. After ſyx dayes, he was in a traunce for cauſe of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3911:37"/> holy ghoſtes comming. When the ſeuenth daye was come, he beganne to miniſter vnto God, that is to witte, he ſayde Maſſe, euery daye. After a certaine tyme thus ſpent, through faith and prayer he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne to write with his owne hande, <hi>myſteria ministrationis,</hi> the Maſſe, or the ſeruice of the Maſſe. On a night our lord came vnto him in a viſion with the Apoſtles, and layde breade to be conſecrated on the holy aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſtirring vp Baſile, ſayd vnto him. <hi>Secundum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulationem tuam repleatur os tuum laude, etc.</hi> According to thy requeſt, let thy mowth be fylled with praiſe, that with thyne owne wordes, thou mayſt offer vp to me ſacrifice. He not able to abide the viſion with his eyes, roſe vp with trembling, and goyng to the holy aulter, beganne to ſaye, that he had written in paper, thus. <hi>Repleatur os meum laude, &amp; hymnum dicat gloriae tuae domine Deus, qui creaſti nos, &amp; adduxiſti in vitam hanc, &amp; caeteras orationes ſancti miniſterij.</hi> Let my mowth be fylled with prayſe, to vtter an hymne to thy glory, Lord God, which haſt created vs, and brought vs in to this lyfe, and ſo foorth the other prayers of the Maſſe. It foloweth in the ſtory. <hi>Et poſt finem orationum, exaltauit panem, ſine intermiſsione orans, &amp; dicens: Reſpice domine Ieſu Chriſte, etc.</hi> After that he had done the prayers of Conſecration, he lyfted vp the bread, praying continually and ſaying, Looke vpon vs lord Ieſus Chriſt out of thy holy tabernacle, and come to ſanctifie vs, that ſitteſt aboue with thy father, and arte here preſent inuiſibly with vs, vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſafe with thy mighty hand to delyuer to vs, and by vs to all thy people, <hi>Sancta Sanctis,</hi> thy holy
<pb facs="tcp:3911:38" rendition="simple:additions"/> thinges to the holy. The people anſwered, one holy, one our lord Ieſus Chriſt, with the holy ghoſt, in glorie of God the father, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let vs conſyder, what foloweth perteining moſt to our purpoſe. <hi>Et diuidens panem in tres partes, vnam quidem communicauit timore multo, alteram autem reſeruauit conſepelire ſecum, tertiam verò impoſuit colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bae aureae, quae pependit ſuper altare.</hi> He diuided the bread in to three partes, of which be receiued one at his communion, with greate feare and reuerence, the other he reſerued, that it might be buried with him, and the third parte he cauſed to be put in a golden pyxe, that was hanged vp ouer the aulter, made in forme and ſhape of a dooue. After this, a litle before the ende of this treatiſe, it foloweth, how that S. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſile at the houre that he departed out of this lyfe, receiued that parte of the hoſte him ſelfe, which he had purpoſed to haue enterred with him in his graue, and immediatly as he laye in his bedde, gaue thankes to God, and rendred vp the ghoſt.</p>
               <p>That this was a priuate Maſſe, no man can denye. Baſile receiued the ſacrament alone, for there was no earthly creature in that churche with him. The people that anſwered him, were ſuch, as Chriſt brought with him. And that all this was no dreame, but a thing by the will of god done in dede, though in a viſion, as it pleaſed Chriſt to exhibite, <hi>Amphilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi> playnely witneſſeth, declaring how that one <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus,</hi> and others the chiefe of that clergie, ſtanding before the gates of the churche, whiles this was in dooing, ſawe lightes with in the churche, and men

               <p>Here M. Iuell and his conſacramentaries doo ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar I doubte not, for graunt to a priuate Maſſe they will not, what ſo euer be brought for proufe of it. and therefore ſome doubte to auoyd this autoritie muſt be deuyſed. But whereof they ſhuld doubte, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely I ſee not.

Here is to be noted,<note place="margin">A true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes place.</note> whereas Chryſoſtome ſayeth, the daily ſacrifice was celebrated in vaine, and the prieſtes ſtoode at th'aulter in vaine: it is not to be vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the ſacrifice in it ſelfe, as though it were in vaine and fruſtrate: but this is to be referred to the people, it was in vaine for their parte, that ſhuld haue receiued their communion with the prieſtes, who waited daily for them, and cryed out as the maner was, <hi>Sancta ſanctis,</hi> holy thinges for the holy. and after that they had receiued the breade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, ſhewing the chalice to the people,<note place="margin">In Miſſa Chryſoſt.</note> ſayd: <hi>Cum timore Dei, &amp; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, &amp; dilectione accedite.</hi> Come ye vp to receiue with the feare of God, with faith and charitie. But all was in vaine. For none came, ſo colde was their deuotion in that behalfe. Now if Chryſoſtome had cauſe to complaine of the peoples ſlaknes in comming to the communion, in that great and populouſe citie of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioche, where the ſcriptures were daily expownded and preached, where diſcipline and good order was more ſtreightely exacted, where in ſo great number ſome of likelyhode were of more deuotion then others: what is to be thought of many other litle townes and villages through the worlde, where litle preaching was heard, where diſcipline ſlaked, where the number of the faithfuls being ſmall, and they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied all together in worldly affayeres, fewe gaue good enſample of deuotion to others? Doubtles in ſuch places was much leſſe reſorte of the people at
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3911:40"/> the Maſſe tyme, to receiue the Sacrament with their prieſtes. And whereas, leaſt this place might ſeme plainely to auouche the hauing of Maſſe without a number communicating with the biſhop or prieſt, for auoyding of this auctoritie, the goſpellers anſwere by waye of coniecture, that in Chryſoſtomes tyme the prieſtes and deacons co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated together daily with the partie that offred the Sacrifice, though none of the people dyd: we tell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that this poore ſhifte will not ſerue their purpoſe. For though they ſaye, ſome ſufficient number euer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated with him that celebrated the dayly ſacrifice in that great and famouſe churche of Antioche, where many prieſtes and deacons were, which neither being denyed they ſhall neuer be able to proue: what may be ſayde or thought of many thouſand other leſſer churches through the world, where the prieſt that ſayd Maſſe, had not alwayes in redynes a ſufficient number of other prieſtes and deacons to receiue with him, ſo to make vp a communion? Of ſuch churches it muſt be ſayde, that either the Sacrifice ceaſed, and that was not done which Chriſt commaunded to be done in his remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which is not to be grawnted: or that the memorie of our lordes death was oftentymes celebrated of the prieſtes in the daily oblation with out tarying for others to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municat with them, and ſo hadde theſe churches priuate Maſſes, as the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches now a dayes haue.

Otherwiſe herein the breache of vnitie is ſo litle recompenſed by the exacte kepinge of th'out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ceremonie, that according to the ſaying of S. Auguſtine, who ſo euer taketh the myſterie of vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and kepeth not the bonde of peace, he taketh not a myſterie for him ſelfe, but a teſtimonie againſt him ſelfe.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:3911:41"/>
               <p>Therefore they haue great cauſe to weigh with them ſelues, what they receiue in this ſacrament, who moued by ſle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der reaſons made for bothe kyndes, do raſhely and dangerouſly condemne the churche, for geuing of it vnder one kinde, to all, that doo not in their owne perſons conſecrate and offer the ſame in remembraunce of the ſacrifice once offered on the croſſe. And that they may thinke the churche to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon good growndes herein, may it pleaſe them to vnderſtand, that the fruite of this ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which they enioye that worthely receiue it, dependeth not of the outward formes of bread and wine, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doundeth of the vertue of the fleſhe and bloude of Chriſt. And whereas vnder either kynde whole Chriſt is verely preſent, (for now that he is riſen againe from the deade, his fleſhe and bloude can be ſundred no more,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> becauſe he dyeth no more) this helthfull ſacrament is of true chriſten people with no leſſe fruit receiued vnder one kynde, then vnder bothe. And as this ſpirituall fruite is not any thinge diminiſhed to him that receiueth one kinde, ſo it is not any whitte increaced to him, that receiueth bothe. The Sacramentaries that beleue not the truth of Chriſtes bodye and bloude in this holy Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, I remitte to ſundry godly treatiſes made in defence of the right faith in that pointe. I thinke it not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie here, to treate thereof, or of any other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which M. Iuell hath not as yet manifeſtly touched in his ſermon.</p>
               <p>Now concerning th'outward formes of bread and wyne, their vſe is imployed in ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely, and
<pb facs="tcp:3911:42" rendition="simple:additions"/> be not of neceſsitie, ſo as grace may not be obteined by worthy receiuing of tbe Sacrament, onleſſe bothe kindes be miniſtred. Therefore in conſecrating of the Sacrament, according to Chriſtes inſtitution, bothe kyndes be neceſſarie, for as much as it is not prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the receiuing onely, but alſo for renewing and ſtirring vp of the remembraunce of oure lordes death. So in as much as the ſacrament ſerueth the ſacrifice, by which the death and oblation of Chriſt is repreſented, bothe the kyndes be requiſite: that by diuerſe and ſundry formes, the bloude of Chriſt ſhedde for our ſynnes, and ſeparated from his body, may euidently be ſignified. But in as much as the faithful people doo receiue the ſacrament, thereby to atteine ſpirituall grace and ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their ſoules, diuerſitie of the formes or kyndes, that be vſed for the ſignification onely, hath no further vſe ne profite. But by one kynde, becauſe in it whole Chriſt is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, abundance of all grace is once geuen: ſo as by the other kynde thereto ouer added (which geueth the ſame and not an other Chriſt) no further aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of ſpirituall grace, may be atteined.</p>
               <p>In conſideration of this, the catholike churche taught by the holy ghoſt all truth, whiles in the daily ſacrifice the memorie of oure lordes death and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is celebrated, for that it is neceſſarie therein to expreſſe moſt playnely the ſhedding and ſeparating of the bloude from the bodye, that was crucified: hath alwayes to that purpoſe, diligently vſed bothe kyndes of breade and wine.

               <p>As touching the wordes of Chriſt, <hi>Bibite ex hoc omnes, Drinke ye all of this:</hi> they perteine to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles only, and to their ſucceſſours. For to them only he gaue commaundement to doo that, which he dyd in his ſupper, as <hi>Clement</hi> ſayeth: To them only ſaying, <hi>doo this in my remembrance,</hi> he gaue commiſsion to conſecrate, offer, and to receiue the ſacrament in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his death and paſsion, by the ſame wordes ordeining the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prieſtes of the newe teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Wherefore this belongeth not to the laye people, neither can it be iuſtely gathered by this place, that they are bounde of neceſsitie, and vnder paine of deadly ſynne, to receiue the ſacrament vnder bothe kyndes.</p>
               <p>And this vnderſtoode they, which aboue an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeres paſt, chaunging the olde cuſtome of the churche of receiuing the communion vnder one kynde, by theire priuate auctoritie, would nedes vſurpe the cuppe alſo.

Iohn: <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte ye eate the fleshe of the ſonne of man, and drinke his bloude, ye shall not haue lyfe in you:</hi> which wordes for
<pb facs="tcp:3911:43" rendition="simple:additions"/> all that oure new maiſters of theſe xl. yeres paſt, will to be vnderſtanded of the ſpirituall and not of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall eating. Which place although it be taken for the ſacramentall eating, as it may be, and is taken for bothe of the doctours vewed a parte: yet in all that chapter there is no mention of the cuppe, nor of wine at all. Wherefore they that crye ſo much on the Inſtitution and commaundement of Chriſt, can not fynde in all the ſcriptures, neither commaundement, where he gaue charge the ſacrament ſo to be geuen, neither ſo much as any example, where Chriſt gaue it vnder bothe kyndes, to any other, then to the Apoſtles. Where as contrary wiſe it may be ſhewed of oure parte, that the ſacrament was geuen vnder one kynde only to the two diſciples, that went to Emaus.<note place="margin">Luc. 24.</note> For that the bread, which Chriſt there tooke, bleſſed, brake, and gaue to them, was not ſimple and common bread, but the Sacrament of the bodye and bloude of Chriſt.

Luke writeth in the Actes of the Apoſtles of the breaking of the bread. If M. Iuell here thinke to auoyde theſe places by their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed figure ſynecdoche, among his owne ſecte happely it may be accepted, but among men of right and learded iudgement, that ſhifte will ſeme ouer weake and vaine. Now to conclude touching the ſixth chapter of S. Ihon, as thereof they can bring no one worde mentioning the cuppe or wyne, for
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3911:43"/> proufe of their bothe kyndes: ſo it ſheweth and not in very obſcure wiſe, that the forme of breade alone is ſufficient, where as Chriſt ſayeth, <hi>Qui manducat pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem hunc, viuet in aeternum,</hi> He that eateth this bread, ſhall lyue for euer.</p>
               <p>Thus oure aduerſaries haue nothing to bring out of the ſcriptures againſt the vſe of the catholike churche in miniſtring the communion vnder one kynde. And yet they ceaſe not crying out vpon the breache of chriſtes expreſſe commaundement, and M. Iuell for his parte in his firſt anſwere to D. Cole, ſayeth, that the councell of Conſtance pronounced openly againſt Chriſt him ſelfe. But for as much as they are ſo hote in this pointe, I will ſend them to Martin Luther him ſelfe their patriarke, that either by his ſobrietie in this matter they may be ſome what colded, or by his, and his ſcolers inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancie herein, be brought to be a ſhamed of them ſelues. Though the places be well knowen, as oftentymes cited of the catholike writers of oure tyme againſt the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers, yet here I thinke good to rehearſe them, that the vnlearned may ſee, how them ſelues make not ſo greate a matter of this Article, as ſome ſeme to beare the people in hand it is.</p>
               <p>Luther wryteth to them of Bohemia theſe very wordes. <hi>Quoniam pulchrum quidem eſſet,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:3911:44" rendition="simple:additions"/> that Chriſt herein hath commaunded nothing as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: it were better to kepe peace and vnitie, which Chriſt hath euery where charged vs withall, then to ſtriue for the outward kyndes of the ſacrament. Agayne his wordes be theſe in a declaration that he wrote of the ſacrament. <hi>Non dixi, neque conſului, neque eſt intentio mea, vt vnus aut aliquot Epiſcopi propria au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate alicui incipiant vtramque ſpeciem porrigere, niſi ita conſtitueretur &amp; mandaretur in concilio generali.</hi> Neither haue I ſayde nor counſailed, nor my minde is, that any one or moe biſhops, begynne by their owne auctoritie, to geue bothe kyndes (of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) to any perſon, onleſſe it were ſo ordeined and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in generall councell.</p>

               <p>That the controuerſie for the one or bothe kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des may be taken awaye, it ſhall be very well done, that holy churche made it free, to receiue this ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in one or bothe kyndes: yet vnder ſuche con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as hereby no occaſion be geuen to any bodye raſhely to conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne the vſe, which the church hath ſo long tyme kepte, nor to iudge one an other.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3911:45"/> matter, as neceſſarie to ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Thus we may ſee playnely, that they which haue diuided them ſelues from the myſticall bodye of Chriſt, that is his churche, who were of greateſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and iudgement, make it a matter indifferent (as it is in dede of it ſelfe lefte to the libertie of the churche) whether the ſacrament be miniſtred vnder one kynde or bothe.</p>

But if it be the commaundement of God, that the Sacrament be receiued of all vnder bothe kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, why ſhuld he be forbydden by the feare of God
<pb facs="tcp:3911:46" rendition="simple:additions"/> to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne thoſe, that wythſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that order of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion?

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by his teſtimonie the vſe of one or bothe kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, is indifferent.</p>
               <p>Thus we are able to alleage Luther, Melanchthon, Bucer, and that learned Bohemian, for the Indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the communion to be miniſter either vnder one kynde, or bothe. Whereby I meane not that the vſe of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is ſo lefte to euery mannes liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as he that liſteth, may require bothe kyndes, and an other may content him ſelfe with one kynde: not ſo, euery man is bownde to folow the order of the churche, but the churche is not bownde of neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by Gods commaundement, to miniſter it vnder bothe kyndes to the laitie.</p>
               <p>And whereas it was miniſtred in bothe kyndes at Corinth, as it appeareth by S. Paul, and in ſundry other places,<note place="margin">Cauſes mouing the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Many other cauſes moued thoſe fathers to take that order, for th'auoyding of many inconueniences, dangers, and offences, which might happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the vſe of the cuppe: as vnreuerence of ſo high a Sacrament, whereof chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten people at the beginning had a meruelouſe care and regarde, the lothſomnes of many, that can not brooke the taſte of wine, the difficultie of getting, and impoſsibilitie of keping wine from corruption in countries ſituated neare to the north Pole, in that clime, where is knowen to be great extremitie of colde, beſyde a number of the like. So that it had ben beſide reaſon to haue bounde all to the neceſsitie of bothe kyndes.</p>
               <p>Now in very dede if we would graunt to oure aduerſaries, which in no wiſe we do not graunt, that it hath ben commaunded of Chriſt, the laye people ſhould communicate vnder bothe kyndes, by theſe wordes: <hi>Drinke ye all of this:</hi> yet this notwithſtanding, the exacte ſtreightnes of gods ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce may without ſynne in caſes be omitted, in ſuch thinges which be not neceſſaryly to be obſerued of them ſelues, or of the preſcripte of the lawe of nature: ſo that great and weighty cauſes (the rule of charitie exactely obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) require the ſame.

In due co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of which, we may fynde, that Chriſt hath ſcarcely commaunded any outward thing, the moderation, qualifying, and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whereof, he hath not lefte to his churche, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition of the tyme, it hath ben ſene moſt expedient for the common preferme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the ſame. So that notwithſtanding there be no ſwaruing from the ſcope, and principal intente, and no creature defrauded of that good, which by the outward thinges is to be atteined. Touching the Sacrament of baptiſme, though nothing be ſayde of the teaching of them, that ſhuld be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, neyther of the dipping of them in to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">Matt. 28.</note> which Chriſtes charge in this behalfe geuen, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth plainely to require, go you (ſayeth he to his Apoſtles) and teach all nations, baptizing them etc: and yet the church hath not feared to baptiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes that be with out capacitie of teaching, and for the due adminiſtration of this Sacrament, to many,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3911:47"/> hath thoughte powring or ſprinkling of water vpon them ſufficient: though this be not ſpoken of I ſaye, it is much to be conſydered to this purpoſe, that the Apoſtles ſtickte not for a tyme to alter and chaunge the very eſſentiall forme of wordes, with which Chriſt would this ſacrament to be miniſtred. For where as he commaunded them to baptiſe in the name of the father, and of the ſonne,<note place="margin">Act. 8.</note> and of the holy ghoſt: th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So to retourne to the Sacrament of the bodye and bloude of Chriſt, whereof we treate, no man can denye, but many thinges were at th'inſtitution of it done by the example of Chriſt, and by him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, which now be not obſerued, and yet in that reſpecte no faulte is fownde. Chriſt waſhed the Apoſtles feete, and gaue them an expreſſe commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to doo the ſame with theſe moſte plaine wordes. <hi>If I that am your Maister and lorde,</hi>

Though it appeare by Saint Bernard,<note place="margin">In ſer. de coena do.</note> who calleth it <hi>Magnum Sacramentum,</hi> a great Sacrament, and long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by reporte of S.

Auguſtine,<note place="margin">Ad Ianua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rium. c. 18</note> or for any other cauſe, it forceth not greatly. But this is much to be merueiled at, that this ſo earneſtly commaunded, is ſo quietly and with ſuch ſilence ſuffered vndone, and in the miniſtration of the Sacrament, the vſe of the cuppe ſo factiouſly and with ſo much crying out required. Neither in many other rites and ceremonies we do not as Chriſt dyd. Chriſt celebrated this ſacrament after that he had ſupped, we do it in the morning, and faſting. Chriſt ſate at the table with his twelue Apoſtles, neither ſytte we at a table, neither thinke we it neceſſary to obſerue ſuch number. Chriſt brake the bread, we thinke it not neceſſary to breake the hoſte, that is to be delyuered to the faithfull participantes. Here is to be noted, that ſaint Cyprian rebuking them which thought ſprinkling or powring of water not to be ſufficient for baptiſme, declareth, that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raments be not to be eſtemed according vnto their extreme and rigorouſe obſeruation or admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of all the externe elementes: but rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the integritie and ſoundnes of faith of the geuer and of the receiuer, and that diuine thinges vſed in a compendious ſorte, conferre and geue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe to the right beleuers their whole vertue. lib. 4. epiſt. 7. Many other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of God concerning outward thinges might here be rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which notwithſtanding by litle and litle in the churche haue ben omitted, as the forebearing of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3911:48"/> ſtrangled thinges and bloude: which was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded by God in the olde teſtament, and according to the pleaſure and aduiſe of the holy goſt, decreed by the Apoſtles in the newe teſtament: yet for as much as concerneth outward thinges, both this, and many other the like, haue in proceſſe of tyme growen out of obſeruation, and haue with out any ſcruple of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ben abrogated.</p>
               <p>I truſte no man will gather of that I haue ſayde here, that it is none offence to doo againſt Gods commaundemente. My meaning is farre otherwiſe. Neither ſaye I, that this ſaying of Chriſt in Mathew, <hi>Drinke ye all of this,</hi> or that in Ihon, <hi>Excepte ye eate the fleſh of the ſonne of man, and drinke his bloude, ye ſhal not haue lyfe in you:</hi> or other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes of Chriſt, be not to be kepte: but this is that I ſaye, and that euery catholike man ſayeth: that the vniuerſall chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che doth better vnderſtand, which are the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of Chriſt, and how they ought to be kepte, then Berengarius, Wiclef, Hus, Luther, Zuinglius, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, Cranmare, Peter Martyr, or any their ſcolers, and folowers, which now be ſundry ſectes. As for example: God hath thus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.

Whereas certaine ſectes of heretikes, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely they which be called Waldenſes, and Picardi, by their conſtruction hereof, haue mainteined opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that no othe ought to be geuen or made in no caſe or reſpecte: lyke wiſe that in no caſe or reſpecte a man may doo an other to death, and alſo that after
<pb facs="tcp:3911:49" rendition="simple:additions"/> the outward letter of the goſpell, ſometyme a man is bounde to pull out his eye, and caſt it from him: which thing hath be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> done by ſome of the Picardes, as it is reported, as though elles Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were not kepte: this hath ſo ben vnderſtanded by the catholike churche, confeſsing neuertheleſſe theſe to be gods commaundementes, as in tyme, in place, and in certaine caſes, a man might and ought without breach of commaundement, bothe ſweare, and kylle, and likewiſe kepe his eye in his head, and therein offend God nothing at all. So the catholike churche vnderſtandeth, <hi>Drynke ye all of this,</hi> to be Chriſtes commaundement, and of neceſsitie to be obſerued, but of prieſtes onely, I meane of neceſsitie, and that, when in the ſacrifice of the church, is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the memorie of Chriſtes death, which in that degree be the ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles, to whom that commaundement was ſpecially geuen, when they were conſecrated prieſtes of the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, who ſo dyd drinke in dede, as S. Marke witneſſeth: <hi>Et biberunt ex eo omnes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 14.</note> And they dranke all of it. To theſe onely, and to none other, the catholike churche hath euer referred the neceſsitie of that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. Elles if the neceſsitie of it ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine to all, and becauſe Chriſt ſayde, <hi>Drinke ye all of this,</hi> if all of euery ſtate and condition of neceſsitie ought to drinke of the cuppe: how is it come to paſſe, that oure aduerſaries them ſelues, (who prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de ſo ſtreight a conſcience herein) kepe from it infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and young children, vntill they come to good yeres of diſcretion: ſpecially where as the cuſtome
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3911:49"/> of the primitiue churche was, that they alſo ſhould be partakers of this ſacrament, as it may playnely be ſene, in <hi>S. Dionyſe, Cyprian, Auguſtine, Innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius, Zoſimus,</hi> and other auncient fathers? what better reaſon haue they to kepe the infantes from the cuppe, then the Anabaptiſtes haue, to kepe them from theire bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme? If they allege their impotencie of remembring our lordes death, the Anabaptiſtes will lihewiſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege their impotencie of receiuing and vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding doctrine, that Chriſtes inſtitution in this behalfe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to require.</p>
               <p>Thus th'aduerſaries of the churche them ſelues doo agniſe, that the vſe of the cuppe in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment perteineth not to all of neceſsitie. So haue they neither godly charitie to ioyne with the churche, neither ſufficient reaſon to impugne the churche. And although herein we could be content, infantes not to be ſpoken of, yet it maye eaſely be proued, that the communion vnder bothe kyndes, hath not euer ben generall. And as we doo not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne it, but confeſſe it might be reſtored agayne by th'au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoritie of the churche lawfully aſſembled in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall councell, vppon mature deliberation before had, and a holeſome remedie againſt the inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences thereof prouided: euen ſo are we hable to ſhewe good auctoritie for the defence of the one kynde, now vſed in the churche. And becauſe M.

                  <note place="margin">Proufes for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion vnder one kinde</note>Here maye be alleaged firſt the example of our lord him ſelfe, out of the 24. chapter of S. Luke, which is ſpoken of before: where it is declared, that he gaue the Sacrament to the two diſciples at Emaus, vnder the forme of bread only, which place ought to haue the more weight of auctoritie in a catholike mannes iudgement, becauſe it is brought by the councell of Conſtance, and alſo by the councell of Baſile, for proufe of the communion vnder one kynde. That it was the Sacrament, the auncient doctours doo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it playnely, and the wordes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferred with the wordes of our lordes ſupper, doo agree: and that it is not nedeful of oure owne head to adde thereto the adminiſtration of the cuppe, as oure aduerſaries doo by their figure ſynecdoche: it appeareth by that thoſe two diſciples declared to the twelue Apoſtles aſſembled together in Ieruſalem, how they knew our lorde, <hi>in fractione panis,</hi> in breakinge of the breade to them, which can not be taken for the wine. and as ſone as they knewe him in breaking of the breade, he vaniſhed awaye from theire ſyght, er that he tooke the cuppe in to his handes, and bleſſed it, and gaue it vnto them, as it appeareth euidently ynough to S.

               <p>Here might be alleaged the place of the Actes in the 2. chapter, where mention is made of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of breakinge of the breade, the cuppe not ſpoken of, which the heretikes called Walde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſes, dyd confeſſe, that it muſt be vnderſtanded of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>in confeſsione ad Vladiſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> and likewiſe the place of the twentith chapter, and ſpecially that of the ſeuen and twentith chapter of the Actes.

               <p>It is not to be merueiled at, albe it S. Paul deliuered to the Corinthians the inſtitution of oure lordes ſupper vnder hothe kyndes, that yet vppon occaſion geuen, and when condition of tyme ſo required, he
<pb facs="tcp:3911:51" rendition="simple:additions"/> miniſtred the communion vnder one kynde, ſith that with out doubte he tooke that holy myſtery vnder one kynde, for the whole Sacrament, as we perceiue by his wordes,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 10.</note> where he ſayeth, <hi>Vnus panis et vnum corpus multi ſumus omnes, qui de vno pane par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipamus.</hi> One breade and one body we being many are, all that doo participate of one breade.

               <p>For thys purpoſe we haue a notable place in the hebrew goſpell of S. Matthew, which S.

Hierome in his booke <hi>de eccleſiaſticis ſcriptoribus, in Iacobo fratre domini.</hi> The wordes touching the communion, that S. Hierome rehearſeth, agree thoroughly with thoſe of S. Luke 24. chapter. <hi>Matthaeus ſic refert. Dominus autem etc.</hi> Matthew reporteth thus. When oure lorde had geuen his ſhrowde vnto the biſhopes ſeruant, he went to Iames, and appeared vnto him: for Iames had made an oth, that he would not eate breade, from that howre he dranke of the cuppe of our lorde, vntill
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3911:51"/> he ſaw him rayſed from the dead. It foloweth a litle after. <hi>Afferte ait dominus menſam, &amp; panem. Statimque addit: Tulit panem, &amp; benedixit, ac fregit, &amp; dedit Iacobo iusto, &amp; dixit ei: frater comede panem tuum, quia reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rexit filius hominis à dormientibus.</hi> Bring the table and ſet on bread quoth our lorde, and by and by it is added: he tooke bread, and bleſſed it, and brake it, and gaue it to Iames the iuſt, and ſayde vnto him: my brother eate thy breade, for the ſonne of man is riſen agayne from the dead. No man can doubte but this was the Sacrament. And wine was there none geuen, for any thing that may be gathered. For it is not likely that S. Iames had wyne in his houſe then, for as much as Egeſippus who was not long after him, witneſſeth of him, that he neuer dranke wyne, but at our lordes ſupper.</p>
               <p>But becauſe perhappes oure aduerſaries will caſte ſome myſte ouer theſe allegations, to darken the truth with theire clowdy gloſes, which be cleare ynough to quiet and ſobre wittes, that geue eare to the holy ghoſt ſpeaking to vs by the mowth of the churche: I will bring forth ſuch witneſſes and proufes for this purpoſe out of auncient fathers, as by no reaſon or Sophiſticall ſhifte, they ſhall be hable to auoyde.

               <p>The examples of keping the holy Sacrament vnder the forme of bread onely, to be in a redines for the ſycke, and for others in tyme of danger, that they might haue their neceſſarie vitaile of lyfe, or viage prouiſion with them, at their departure hence, be in maner infinite.

S. Ambroſe at the houre of death, receiued the communion vnder one kynde, kepte for that purpoſe, as it appeareth by this teſtimonie of Paulinus, who wrote his life.

               <p>Now where as ſome ſaye, that the Sacrament to be geuen vnder the forme of bread, was firſt dipte in the bloude of oure lorde, and would haue ſo vſed nowe alſo for the ſicke, and that it is ſo to be taken for the whole and intiere Sacrament, as though the Sacrament vnder forme of bread were not of it ſelfe ſufficient: let them vnderſtand, that this was an olde errour condemned aboue twelue hundred yeres paſt, by Iulius the firſt, that great defender of Athanaſius. who hereof in an epiſtle to the biſhoppes through Egypte,<note place="margin">De conſe. diſtinct. 2. can. cum omne cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> wrote thus. <hi>Illud verò quod pro complemento communionis intinctam tradunt euchariſtiam populis, nec hoc prolatum ex euangelio teſtimonium receperunt, vbi Apoſtolis corpus ſuum dominus commendauit &amp; ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:3911:56"/> they haue not receiued this teſtimonie pronounced out of the goſpel, where oure lorde gaue his body and his bloude. For the geuing of the bread is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded aparte by it ſelfe, and the geuing of the cuppe aparte lykewiſe by it ſelfe. And where as ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde in the tyme of <hi>Vitellianus,</hi> would haue brought in agayne this abrogated cuſtome, it was in like maner conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned and aboliſhed, <hi>in tertio Concilio Braccarenſi. Can.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Now I referre me to the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the reader, of what opinion ſo euer he bee, whether for proufe of the communion vnder one kynde, we haue any word, ſentence, or clauſe at all, or no: and whether theſe wordes of M. Iuell in his ſermon,<note place="margin">Fol. 16. in the ende.</note> be true or no, where he ſayeth thus: <hi>it was vſed through out the whole catholike churche ſix hundred yeres after Christes aſcenſion, vnder bothe kyndes, with out exception.</hi> That it was ſo vſed, yea ſix hundred yeres, and long after, we denye not: but that it was ſo alwayes, and in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place vſed, and with out exception, that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye. and vpon what growndes we doo it, let M. Iuell him ſelfe be iudge.</p>
               <p>If ſome of oure allegations may bee with violence wreſted from oure purpoſe, verely a great number of them can not, the auctoritie of the auncient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who wrote them, remayning inuiolated. Where of it foloweth, that after the iudgement of theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, where as Chriſt inſtituted this bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and commaunded it to be celebrated, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in remembraunce of his death: he gaue no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary commaundement, either for the one, or for
<pb facs="tcp:3911:57" rendition="simple:additions"/> both kyndes, (beſyde and without the celebration of the Sacrifice) but lefte that to the determination of the churche. Now that the churche for th'auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of vnreuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, periles, offences, and other weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and important cauſes, hath decreed it in two ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall councelles, to be receiued of the laye people vnder one kynde onely, we thinke it good with all humblenes to ſubmite oure ſelues to the churche herein:<note place="margin">Matth. 18.</note> which churche, Chriſt commaundeth to be heard and obeyed, ſaying, <hi>he that heareth not the churche, let him be to the, as a heathen, and as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican.</hi> In doing whereof we weigh aduiſedly with oure ſelues, the horrible danger that remaineth for them, who be auctoures of ſchiſme, and breakers of vnitie.</p>
               <p>Now for anſwere to M. Iuelles place alleaged out of <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> which is the chiefe that he and all other the aduerſaries of the churche haue to bring for theire purpoſe in this pointe, this much may be ſayde. Firſt,<note place="margin">Gelaſius his canon guilefully by M. Iuel alleaged, truly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</note> that he alleageth Gelaſius vntruly, making him to ſownde in engliſh otherwiſe, then he doth in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine. M. Iuelles wordes be theſe. <hi>Gelaſius an olde father of the Church and a byſshop of Rome, ſayeth that to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister the communion vnder one kinde, is open ſacrilege.</hi> But where ſayeth Gelaſius ſo? this is no ſyncere han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deling of the matter. And becauſe he knewe, the wordes of that father imported not ſo much: guile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully he reciteth them in latine, and doth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh them: which he would not haue omitted, if they had ſo plainely made for his purpoſe. The wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Gelaſius be theſe. <hi>Diuiſio vnius eiuſdemque my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterij,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3911:57"/> ſine grandi ſacrilegio non poteſt peruenire.</hi> The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion of one and the ſame myſtery, can not come with out great ſacriledge. Of theſe wordes he can not conclude Gelaſius to ſaye, that to miniſter the communion vnder one kynde, is open ſacriledge.</p>
               <p>Gelaſius rebuketh and abhorreth the diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that high myſterie, which vnder one forme, and vnder bothe, is <hi>vnum idemque,</hi> one and the ſame, not one vnder the forme of breade, and an other vnder the forme of wine, not one in reſpecte of the bodye, and an other in reſpecte of the bloude: but <hi>vnum idem<expan>

                     </expan>,</hi> one and the ſelfe ſame. The wordes afore recited be taken out of a fragment of a Canon of Gelaſius, which is thus, as we fynde in Gratian.<note place="margin">De con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrat. diſtin. 2. can. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But we haue founde, that ſome hauing receiued onely the portion where in is the holy bodye, abſteine, from the cuppe of the ſacred bloude: who with out doubte (for as much as I knowe not with what ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition they be taught to be tyed) either let them receiue the whole Sacramentes, or let them be kepte from the whole: becauſe the diuiſion of one and the ſame myſtery, can not comme without great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge.</p>
               <p>Here might be ſayde to M. Iuell, ſhewe vs the whole epiſtle of Gelaſius, from whence this fragme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb facs="tcp:3911:58" rendition="simple:additions"/> is taken, that we maye weigh the circumſtance, and the cauſes why he wrote it, conferring that goeth before, and that foloweth, and we will frame you a reaſonable anſwere. But it is not extant. and therfore your argument in that reſpecte, is of leſſe force. But for auoyding of that, oure aduerſaries would hereof conclude, it is to be vnderſtanded, that this canon ſpeaketh agaynſt the heretikes named <hi>Manichaei:</hi> who in the tyme of <hi>Leo</hi> the firſt, about fourty yeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> went about to ſpredde their hereſie in Rome, and in the parties of Italie. Their hereticall opinion was, that Chriſt tooke not oure fleſhe and bloude, but that he had a pha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taſticall bodye, and dyed not, ne roſe agayne trulye and in dede, but by waye of phantaſie. And therefore at the communion, they abſteined from the cuppe, and the better to cloke their hereſie, came to receiue the Sacrament in the forme of breade with other catholike people. Againſt whom <hi>Leo</hi> ſayeth thus.<note place="margin">Serm. 4. de quadra geſima.</note> 
                  <hi>Abdicant enim ſe ſacramento ſalutis noſtrae, etc.</hi> They dryue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues awaye from the Sacrament of oure ſaluation. And as they denye, that Chriſt oure lorde was borne in truth of oure fleſhe, ſo they beleue not that he dyed, and roſe agayne truly. And for this cauſe, they condemne the daye of oure ſaluation and gladnes (that is the ſunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye) to be their ſadde faſtinge daye. And where as to cloke theire infidelitie, they dare to be at oure myſteries: they temper them ſelues ſo in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Sacramentes, as in the meane tyme they may the more ſafely kepe them priuye. With vnworthy mowth they receiue Chriſtes bodye, but
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3911:58"/> to drinke the bloude of oure redemption, vtterly they will none of it. Which thing we would aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe your holynes of, that bothe ſuch men maye be manifeſted by theſe tokens vnto you, and alſo that they whoſe deuiliſh ſimulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and fayning is fownde, being brought to light, and bewrayed of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of ſaintes, maye be thruſt out of the churche, by prieſtly auctoritie. Thus farre be Leo his wordes.</p>
               <p>Gelaſius that ſucceded fourty yeres after Leo, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed no leſſe diligence then he dyd, vtterly to vanquiſh and aboliſh that horrible hereſie. of whom Platina wryteth, that he baniſhed ſo many mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as were fownde at Rome, and there openlye burned their bookes. And becauſe this hereſie ſhuld none elles where take roote and ſpringe, he wrote an epiſtle to <hi>Mai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ricus</hi> and <hi>Ioannes</hi> two biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, amongeſt other thinges warning them of the ſame. Out of which epiſtle, this fragment onely is taken, whereby he doth bothe briefly ſhewe what the Maniches dyd for cloking of their infidelitie, as Leo ſayeth: and alſo in as muche as their opinion was, that Chriſtes bodye had not verye bloude, as being phantaſticall onely, and therefore ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly abſteined fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cuppe of that holy bloude: geueth charge and commaundement, that either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking their hereſie they receiue the whole Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, to witte, vnder bothe kyndes, or that they be kepte from them wholy.</p>

               <p>Much might be alleaged for proufe of hauing Seruice in the Greke and in the Latine churches, long before the firſt ſyx hundred yeres were expired, which is not denyed. The thing that is denyed by M. Iuell, is this. That for the ſpace of ſyx hundred yeres after Chriſt, any Chriſten people had their Seruice or common prayers, in a tonge they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode not. Which they of his ſyde beare the world in hande, to be a haynouſe erroure of the churche, and a wicked deceite of the papiſtes. And I ſaye, as I ſayde before, that the Seruice was then in a tonge,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3911:60"/> which ſome people vnderſtoode, and ſome vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode not.

For that it was with in the ſyx hundred yeres in any other barbarous or vulgare tonge, I neuer reade, neither I thinke M.

Now if M. Iuell, or any of our learned aduerſaries, or any man lyuing could ſhewe good euidence and proufe, that the publike Seruice of the churche, was then in the Syriacall or Arabike, in the Egyptian, Ethiopian,
<pb facs="tcp:3911:61" rendition="simple:additions"/> Perſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Armenia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Scythian, Frenche or Britaine tonge: then might they iuſtly clayme preſcription againſt vs in this Article, then might they charge vs with the example of antiquitie, then might they requyre vs to yelde to the maner and auctoritie of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue churche. But that doubteles can not appeare. Which if any could ſhewe, it would make much for the Seruice to be had in the vulgare tonge.</p>
               <p>Wherefore M. Iuell in his ſermon, which he vttered in ſo ſolemne an audience, and hath ſet forth in print to the world, ſayeth more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is able to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie,<note place="margin">Folio. 16.</note> where he ſpeaketh generally thus. <hi>Before the people grewe to corruption,</hi> (whereby he meaneth the firſt ſyx hundred yeres after Chriſt) <hi>all chriſten men through out the world, made their common prayers, and had the holy communion in their owne common and knowen tonge.</hi> This is ſone ſpoken Syr, but it will not by you be ſo ſone prooued. In dede we fynde, that where as holy Ephrem deacon of the churche of Edeſſa, wrote many thinges in the Syriacall tonge, he was of ſo worthy ſame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome,<note place="margin">Lib. de ſcriptori. eccleſiaſt.</note> that (as S. Hierome witneſſeth) his writinges were rehearſed in certaine churches openly, <hi>poſt le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionem ſcripturaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> after the ſcriptures had ben reade. Whereof it appeareth to <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> that nothing was wont then to be reade in the churches, beſyde the writinges of the Apoſtles, or at leaſt of ſuch men, as were of Apoſtolike auctoritie. But by this place of S. Hierome, it ſemeth not, that Ephrems workes were vſed as a parte of the common Seruice: but rather as homelies or exhortations to be reade after the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3911:61"/> which conſiſted in maner wholly of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And whether they were tourned in to greke or no ſo ſone, it is vncertaine.</p>
               <p>Neither S. Hieromes tranſlation of the ſcriptures in to the Dalmaticall tonge (if any ſuch was by him made at all) proueth, that the Seruice was then in that vulgare tonge. That labour may be thought, to haue ſerued to an other purpoſe. But of the tranſlation of the ſcriptures into vulgare tonges, I ſhall ſpeake hereafter, when I ſhall come to that peculiar Article. Verely the handeling of this preſent and of that, hath moſt thinges common to bothe. Thus that the people of any countrie had the churche Seruice in their vulgare and common tonge, beſyde the Greke and the Latine tonge, we leaue as a matter ſtowtly affirmed by M. Iuell, but faintly proued, yea nothing at all proued.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the two learned tonges, Greke and Latine, and firſt the Greke. That the Seruice was in the greke tonge, and vſed in the greke chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, I graunt. And to ſhewe what is meant by the Greke churche, the learned doo vnderſtand, all the chriſten people of that countrie, which properly is called Graecia, of Macedonia, Thracia, and of Aſia the leſſer, and the countries adioyning. The prouinces that were allotted to the Patriarke of Alexandria in Egypte, and to the patriarke of Antiochia in Syria, are of the olde writers called ſometyme, by the name of the Orientall or Eaſt churche, ſometyme, of the Greke churche.</p>
               <p>This much by vs bothe confeſſed M. Iuell and
<pb facs="tcp:3911:62" rendition="simple:additions"/> agreed vpon: I ſaye, that if I can ſhewe, that the people of ſome countries of the Greke churche, which all had their common prayers and Seruice in the Greke tonge, for the more parte vnderſtoode not the greke tonge, more then Engliſhe men now vnderſtand the Latine tonge: then I haue proued, that I promyſed to proue: that ſome peoples, I meane whole nations, vnderſtoode not their Seruice, for that they had it in an vnknowen tonge.</p>
               <p>Now how well I am able to proue this, I referre it to your owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration. The leſſer Aſia being a principall parte of the greke churche,<note place="margin">All peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Greke churche vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode not the greke ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</note> had then the Seruice in the greke tonge. But the people of ſundry regions and countries of the leſſer Aſia then vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode not the greke tonge: Ergo the people of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry regions and countries had then their Seruice in an vnknowen tonge. The firſt propoſition or <hi>maior,</hi> is confeſſed as manifeſt, no learned man will denye it, and if any would, it may eaſely be proued. The ſecond propoſition or <hi>minor,</hi> maye thus be proued. <hi>Strabo</hi> who trauailed ouer all the countries of Aſia, for perfite knowledge of the ſame, neare about the tyme of S. Paules peregrination there, who alſo was borne in the ſame: in his 14. booke of Geographie writeth, that where as with in that Cherroneſus, that is, the ſtreight betwen ſea and ſea, there were ſyxten nations by reporte of Ephorus: of them all onely three were grekes, all the reſt barbarous. Likewiſe Plinius in the ſyxth booke natural. hiſtor. cap. 2. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, that with in the circuite of that land, were three greke nations onely, Dores, Iones, Eoles, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3911:62"/> that the reſte were barbarous, amongeſt whom the people of Lycaonia was one, who in S. Paules tyme ſpake before Paul and Barnabas,<note place="margin">Act. 14.</note> in the Lycaonical tonge.</p>
               <p>The ſcripture it ſelfe reporteth a diuerſitie of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage there, and thereabout, as it appeareth by the ſecond chapter of the Actes. Where the Iewes ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in Ieruſalem for keping of the feaſt of Pentecoſte, wondering at the Apoſtles for their ſpeaking with ſo many ſundry tonges, emonges other prouinces different in language, they rekon Pontus and Aſia, Cappadocia, Phrygia and Pamphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia. Which two prouinces are of all attributed vnto the leſſer Aſia. Which maketh a good argument, that all Aſia the leſſer had not one onely the greke to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge. and therefore ſo many of them as were of other language, hauing the Seruice in greke, had it in a tonge they vnderſtode not.</p>
               <p>They that will ſeme to ſerche the cauſe why that land had ſo great diuerſitie of languages, impute it to the often chaunge of conqueſtes, for that it was ouercome and poſſeſſed of diuerſe nations: of which euery one coueted with enlarging their Empyre, to bring into the countries ſubdued, their lawes, their cuſtomes, and their language. Now this being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by good and ſufficient auctoritie, that in Aſia, of xvj. nations three onely were Grekes, it foloweth, that the other thirtene hauing their Seruice in greke, had it not in their owne, but in a ſtraunge tonge. For elles if they had all naturally ſpoken greke, why ſhuld not they haue ben called grekes? Thus we ſee it is
<pb facs="tcp:3911:63" rendition="simple:additions"/> no newe thing proceding of a generall corruption in the churche, ſome peoples to haue the Seruice in an vnknowen tonge.</p>
               <p>Here perhappes M. Iuell, or ſome other for him, replyeth and ſayeth, that the people of Aſia com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly beſyde their owne proper language, ſpake the greke tonge alſo, and alleageth for that purpoſe <hi>S. Hierome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In prooe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio 2. lib. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ment. epiſt. ad Galatas.</note> who, ſayeth, <hi>Galatas, excepto Sermone Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, quo omnis Oriens loquitur, propriam linguam eandem habere, quam Treuiros.</hi> That the Galathians, beſyde the greke language, which all the Orient or the Eaſt ſpeaketh, haue their owne peculiar tonge, the very ſame, that they of Treueres haue. Lo, ſayeth this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyer, S. Hierome affirmeth all the Orient to ſpeake the greke tonge. Ergo the Seruice in greke to them was not ſtraunge and vnknowen.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwere S. Hierome meaneth, that ſome of all countries of the Orient or eaſt, ſpake greke, as the learned men, gentle men, merchantes, all of libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall education, and ſuch other, as had cauſe to trauaile thoſe countries. To be ſhorte, it was with out doubte very common, as being their only learned tonge for all ſciences, and the tonge that might beſt ſerue to trauaile with all from countrie to countrie with in the Eaſt, right ſo as the Latine tonge ſerueth to the like intentes, for all nations of the Weſt. And he meaneth not that all and ſingular perſons, of what degree or condition ſo euer they were, all vplandiſh people, tillers of the grownde, herdmen and women, ſpake greke. For if it had ben ſo, then had they not had peculiar and proper tonges. For it is not for
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3911:63"/> their ſimple headdes (for the moſt parte) to beare a waie two languages. In that S. Hierome calleth the Galathians tonge <hi>propriam linguam,</hi> a proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar tonge to that nation, he doth vs to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, the ſame to perteine to all in particular, that is, to euery one of that prouince, and the greke, to all in generall, in reſpecte of other nations there, ſo as not of neceſsitie it be vnderſtanded of euery one.</p>
               <p>S. Auguſtine ſpeaking of the title written by Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late on the croſſe, ſayeth thus. It was in Hebrew,<note place="margin">Tracta. in Ioan. 117.</note> Greke, and Latine, <hi>Rex Iudaeorum.</hi> For theſe three tonges were there in preeminence before all other. <hi>Hebraea, propter Iudaeos in Dei lege gloriantes, Graeca, propter gentium Sapientes, Latina, propter Romanos multis ac penè omnibus iam tunc gentibus imperantes.</hi> The, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewe, for the Iewes, that gloried in the lawe of God, the greke, for the wiſe men of the gentiles, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, for the Romaines bearing rule at that tyme ouer many, and almoſt ouer all nations. Now where he ſayeth here, that the greke tonge was in preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, <hi>propter gentium Sapientes,</hi> for the wiſe men of the ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles: he diſcuſſeth fully the doubte, that might ſeme to riſe of S. Hieromes ſaying, and ſheweth, that the greke tonge was common, not to all the vulgare people of the whole Orient, but to the wiſe men onely, and that for the atteyning of learning. And for this it is to be noted, that the ſcripture reporteth the vulgare tong of the Lycaonians to haue ben vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in hearing of Paul and Barnabas, not by the Magiſtrates, or other the chiefe, but by the vulgare people. <hi>Turbae leuauerunt vocem ſuam Lycaonicè di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centes,
<pb facs="tcp:3911:64" rendition="simple:additions"/> etc. Act.</hi> 2. And ſo S. Hierome is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanded to ſpeake in that place, not of all men of the nations of the Eaſt, but rather of a great number, and of ſome perſons of all nations. For elles if all the Eaſt had ſpoken greke, the ſouldiers that buried <hi>Gordia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> the younger, Emperour, apud <hi>Circeium Caſtrum,</hi> at Circey caſtle, neare to the land of Perſie: would not haue written his title of honour vpon his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, in greke and latine, in the Perſians, Iewes, and the Egyptians tonges, <hi>vt ab omnibus legeretur,</hi> that it might be read of all,<note place="margin">In Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dij<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> as <hi>Iulius Capitolinus</hi> writeth. Which is an argument, that all the Eaſt ſpake not ne vnderſtoode not the greke tonge. As likewiſe that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> writeth,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſi. 66.</note> where he ſayeth thus. Moſt of the Perſians after the perſicall letters, vſe alſo the Syrianes letters. As with vs many nations vſe the greke letters, yea where as in euery nation in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they haue letters of their owne. And others ſome much eſteme the moſt profownde tonge of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and the tonge that is about Palmyra, both the tonge it ſelfe, and alſo the letters of the ſame. Bookes alſo haue ben written of Manes in the Syrianes tonge. Agayne if all the Eaſt had ſpoken greke, ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry the holy fathers would not haue ben ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiouſe to the common weale of the churche, as to hyde their ſingular workes from the reading of all, which they wrote in barbarouſe and vulgare ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to the commoditie only of their brethren that vnderſtoode the ſame. <hi>Antonius,</hi> that wrote ſeuen notable epiſtles to diuerſe monaſteries,<note place="margin">Lib. de eccleſiaſt. ſcript.</note> of apoſtolike ſenſe and ſpeache, as S. Hierome witneſſeth, in the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3911:64"/> Egyptian tonge. Likewiſe holy Ephrem of Edeſſa, Bardeſanes of Meſopotamia, who wrote very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent workes in the Syriacall tonge. Euen ſo dyd Iſaac of Antioche, and Samuel of Edeſſa prieſtes, write many goodly workes againſt the ennemies of the churche, in the ſame tonge, as Gennadius recordeth.</p>
               <p>But what ſhall we ſpeake of all the Eaſt? neither all the leſſer Aſia, and the countries there adioyning, ſpake not greke one generation before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Chriſt. For if all had ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> greke, Mithridates that renoumed king of Pontus, had not neded to haue learned two and twenty languages of ſo many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he was king ouer, to make anſwere to ſuters, to appoint them orders and lawes, and in open au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to ſpeake to them in ſo many languages with out an interpreter, as Plinie writeth.<note place="margin">Natural. hiſt. lib. 7. cap. 24.</note> Here if theſe 22. nations of 22. ſundry tonges, had alſo beſyde their owne language ſpoken greke, and vnderſtanded the ſame: Plinie would not haue vttered that word, <hi>ſine interprete,</hi> without an interpreter. And likewiſe that king had taken vaine labour in learning thoſe ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, where one might haue ſerued his tourne.</p>
               <p>Neare to this kinges dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ſhore of the ſea Euxinus, in the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de of Colchis,<note place="margin">Li. 6. nat. hiſt. ca. 5.</note> there ſtoode a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie named Dioſcurias, ſo much haunted of ſtraungers, that as Plinie writeth by recorde of Timoſthenes, it was reſorted vnto of three hundred nations of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincte languages, and that the Romaines for the better expeditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their affaires there, had at lenghth lying in the ſame, cxxx. interpreters. Now if all the Orient had ſpoken greke, as S. Hieromes wordes
<pb facs="tcp:3911:65"/> ſeme to importe: the Romaines ſhuld not haue neded to haue maineteyned there to theire great charges, ſo great a number of interpreters, to be their agentes there. But for proufe that all the Orient ſpake not greke, what nede we alleage prophane wryters? the knowen place of the Actes, maketh mencion of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry nations there, that had diſtincte languages, the Parthians, Medians, and Elamites etc. Act. 2.</p>
               <p>To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, they that to maineteine their ſtraunge opinion of the vniuerſall vnderſtanding of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice vſed of olde tyme in the Eaſt Churche, ſaye and affirme, that all the Orient ſpake greke: ſeme much to diminiſhe the maieſtie, vtilitie, and neceſsitie of the miraculouſe gifte of tonges, which the holy ghoſt gaue in the primitiue churche, for the better furtherance of the goſpell. For if all in thoſe parties had ſpoken greke, the gifte of tonges had ben in that reſpecte nedeles. Hytherto of the greke, and of the Seruice in that language.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the Latine tonge, which is the learned tonge of the Weſt. That the Latine churche, or the Weſt churche, for ſo it is called, had the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in Latine, I graunt. The chiefe Regions and countries of the Latine churche, with in the forſayd ſyx hundred yeres, were theſe. Italie, Aphrike, Illyrike, bothe Pannonies, now called Hungarie and Auſtria, Gallia, now Fraunce, and Spaine. The cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie, Pole, and Swethen, and thoſe north partes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the faith long ſithens. The countries of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine here had receiued the faith in moſt places, but were dryuen from the open profeſsion of it agayne,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3911:65"/> by the cruell perſecution of Diocletian the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, at which perſecution, S. Albane with many others, ſuffered martyrdom.</p>
               <p>After that theſe countries had ben inſtructed in the faith, as thinges grewe to perfection, they had their Seruice accordingly: no doubte ſuch, as was vſed in the churches, from whence their firſt Apoſtles and preachers were ſent. And becauſe the firſt prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the faith came to theſe weſt parties from Rome, directed ſome from S. Peter, ſome from Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſome others afterward from other biſhops of that See Apoſtolike: they planted and ſet vp in the countries by them conuerted, the Seruice of the churche of Rome, or ſome other very like, and that in the Latine tonge onely, for ought that can be ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed to the contrary. Wherein I referre me onely to the firſt ſyx hundred yeres. Now that ſuch Seruice was vnderſtanded of thoſe peoples, that ſpake and vnderſtoode Latine, no man denyeth. For to ſome nations that was a natiue and a mother tonge, as the greke was to the Grecians.</p>
               <p>M. Iuell alleaging for the hauing of the prayers and Seruice in a vulgare tonge (as for England in the Engliſh, for Ireland in the Iriſhe, for doucheland in the douche tonge, etc) authorities and examples of the churches, where in the tyme of the primitiue churche the greke and Latine tong was the vſuall and common tonge of the people: bringeth nothing for proufe of that, which lyeth in controuerſie.

This much S. Auguſtine there. And this is the right meaning of that Conſtitution. And thus he ordeined for the greke churche onely, and thereto only it is to be referred, for that ſome thought the Sacrifice ſhuld be celebrated rather with ſilence, after the maner of the churche of Rome, ſpecially at the conſecration. And as that conſtitution perteined to the Grekes, and not to the Latines, ſo was it not fownde in the Latine bookes, vntill Gregorius Haloander of Germanie of late yeres tranſlated the place.

               <p>For further anſwere to the auctoritie of Iuſtinianes ordinance, we holde well with it. Good men thinke it meete, the Seruice be vttered now alſo, with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincte and audible voice, that all ſortes of people, ſpecially ſo many as vnderſtand it, may the more be ſtirred to deuocion, and thereby the rather be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to ſaye <hi>Amen,</hi> and geue their aſſent to it, through their obedience and credite, they beare to the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, aſſuring them ſelues, the ſame to be good and helthfulll, and to the glory of God.

               <p>Now to ſaye ſomewhat touching the common prayers or Seruice of the curches of Aphrica, where S, Auguſtine preached in Latine, as you ſaye, and I denye not, and thereof you ſeme to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that the common people of that countrie vnderſtoode and ſpake latine, as their vulgare tonge. That the Aphri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane churches had their Seruice in Latine, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by ſundry places of S. Auguſtine, in his expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3911:68"/> of the Pſalmes, in his bookes <hi>De Doctrina Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiana,</hi> and in his ſermons, and moſt plainely in an epiſtle that he wrote to S. Hierome, in which he ſheweth, that the people of a citie in Aphrica was greatly moued and offended with their biſhop, for that in reciting the ſcriptures for parte of the ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to them, he read out of the fourth chapter of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas the Prophete, not <hi>cucurbita,</hi> after the olde texte, which they had ben accuſtomed vnto, but <hi>hedera,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the newe tranſlation of S.

Lib. 3.2. belli pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nici.</note> Now as I graunt, that ſome vnderſtoode it, ſo I haue cauſe to doubte, whether ſome others vnderſtoode it, or no. Nay rather I haue great probabilitie to tkinke, they vnderſtoode it not. For the bewraying of Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibals Ambaſſadoures to the Romaines, by their Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall language, whereof <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> writeth: and likewiſe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference betwixte Sylla the noble man of Rome, and Bocchus kinge of <hi>Numidia,</hi> had by meane of interpreters adhibited of bothe parties, as Saluſte recordeth <hi>in bello Iugurthino,</hi> declareth, that the tonge of Aphrica was the punicall tonge before the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines conqueſte. Now the ſame people remaining there vntill S. Auguſtines tyme, what ſhuld moue vs to iudge, that they forgate their owne natiue and mother tonge, and learned a newe the latine tonge? I confeſſe that many vnderſtoode and ſpake latine, by reaſon of the Romaines common reſorte thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of their lawes there executed, of their garniſons there abyding, and ſpecially of the great multitude of latine people thyther ſent to inhabite, <hi>deductis co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonijs,</hi> by Auguſt the Emperour firſt, then by <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3911:69" rendition="simple:additions"/> and afterward by <hi>Comodus,</hi> who would haue had the great citie Carthago newly reedified, to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led after his owne name, <hi>Alexandria Comodiana,</hi> as <hi>Lampridius</hi> writeth. Theſe Romaine colonies, that is to witte, multitudes of people ſent to inhabite the countrie, placed them ſelues about the ſea coſtes, in the chiefe cities, in <hi>Carthago, Vtica, Hippo, Leptis, etc.</hi> and thereabout. And by this meanes the Romaine or Latine ſpeache ſpred abroade there, and became to be very commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as that which remained ſtill among the inhabitantes, that were of the Romaine kynde, and was learned by long vſe and cuſtome of others dwelling amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt them, ſpecially in the cities, where the Romaines bare the ſwea and gouernement. For theſe conſyderations, I thinke the Latine tonge was there very common. But that it was common to the inwarde parties of the countrie alſo, and to the vpla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhe people, amongeſt whom the olde accuſtomed language is longeſt kepte, as experience teacheth: it is not likely. For though the nobilitie and cities chaunge their language, to be the more in eſtimation, yet the common and baſe people of the countrie, fall not ſo ſone to a chaunge. In this realme of England after William Conqueroures tyme, by occaſion of great reſortes of Frencheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hyther, and of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie men in to Fraunce, alſo of the Frenche lawes, and ſpeciall fauour by the princes borne, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes beſtowed vpon thoſe that ſpake Frenche: the moſt parte of the nobilitie, lawyeres, merchantes, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitaines, ſouldiers and welthy folke, had ſkill in the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding and ſpeaking of the Frenche tonge, but
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:3911:69"/> yet the common and vplandiſh people ſpake litle or nought at all. Whereof grewe this prouerbe in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of olde tyme, lacke would be a gentilman, but lacke can no frenche. The like may be thought of the Latine tonge of Aphrica.</p>
               <p>What ſhall we thinke of the vplandiſh people there, when as <hi>Septimius Seuerus</hi> the Emperour, yea after the Apoſtles tyme, had not very good ſkill in the Latine tonge, but in the punicall tonge, and that being borne at <hi>Leptis?</hi> of whom <hi>Aurelius Victor</hi> ſayeth thus <hi>in Epitome. Latinis literis ſufficienter inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus, Punica lingua promptior, quippe genitus apud Leptim Prouinciae Aphricae.</hi> Seuerus was learned in the latine lettres ſufficiently, but in the punicall tonge he was redyer, as being borne at <hi>Leptis,</hi> within the prouince of Aphrica. Here the Latine tonge is attributed to inſtruction and teaching, and the punicall tonge to nature. <hi>Aelius Spartianus</hi> writing the lyfe of this Seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus to Diocletian, ſheweth, that when his ſyſter a woman of <hi>Leptis,</hi> came to Rome to him, <hi>vix latinè loquens,</hi> her brother the Emperoure was a ſhamed of her, and bluſhed at her, for that ſhe could ſcantly ſpeake Latine, and therefore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded her a waie home againe to her countrie, for theſe be the very wordes of Spartianus. Now if ſuch noble perſonages lackte the latine ſpeache in the chiefe parte of Aphri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, it is ſone vnderſtanded, what is to be demed of the common and vulgare people abroade in the countrie. Let vs come downe lowgher euen to S. Hieromes tyme. S. Hierome writing to a noble young Romaine virgine called
<pb facs="tcp:3911:70" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                  <hi>Demetrias,</hi> being in Aphrica, exhorting her to kepe her ſelfe in that holy ſtate of virginitie, ſayeth thus. <hi>Vrbs tua quondam orbis caput, etc.</hi> Thy citie once the head of the world, is becomme the ſepulchre of the Romaine people, and wilt thou take a baniſhed huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, thy ſelfe beyng a baniſhed woman, in the ſhore of Libya? what woman ſhalt thou haue there, to bring thee too and fro? <hi>Stridor Punicae linguae procacia tibi feſcennina cantabit.</hi> The iarryng punical tonge ſhall ſing thee bawdy ſonges at thy weddyng. Lo, in S. Hieromes tyme they of Aphrica ſpake the puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call tonge, and that by the ſea ſyde, where the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines of long tyme had made their abode. Of this maye be gathered, that the latine ſpeache was not in the farther parties within the countrie, very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon.</p>
               <p>S. Auguſtine in ſundry places of his workes ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that the people of Aphrica called punikes, ſpake the punicall tonge,<note place="margin">De verbis domini ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Luc. Serm. 35.</note> acknowledging a likenes and cooſynage, as it were, to be betwen that and the Hebrew tonge. But moſt euident witnes for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall tonge, is to be fownde in his 44. epiſtle <hi>ad Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximum Madaurenſem.</hi> In which he anſwereth him ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, for his ſcoffing and ieſting at certaine punicall wordes, in derogation of the Chriſtianes. After won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that he being an Aphricane borne, and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Aphricanes, ſhuld fynde faulte with the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall names and wordes, and after commendation of the tonge, for that many thinges haue right wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely ben commended to memorie by great learned men in bookes of the punicall language: at length concluded againſt him thus. <hi>Poeniteat te certè ibi na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:3911:70"/> vbi huiuſmodi linguae cunabula recalent.</hi> In good footh thou mayeſt be ſorye in thy heart, that thou were borne there, where the cradelles of ſuch a tonge, be warme agayne. By which wordes he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to charge him with an vnnaturall griefe and repenting, that he was borne in that countrie, where they ſpeake punike, er they creape out of their cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delles. Whereby it appeareth, the mother tonge of thoſe parties of Aphrica which he ſpeaketh of, to be the punicall, and not the latine. To conclude, if they had all ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> latine, and not ſome the punicall tonge, S. Auguſtine would neuer haue wrytten,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. de peccatoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meritis et remiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. ca. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Punici Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiani baptiſmum, ſalutem, Eucharistiam, vitam vocant:</hi> That thoſe Chriſtianes which ſpeake the punicall tonge, call baptiſme in their language, helth or Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and the Euchariſt, lyfe. Wherefore we ſee that there were Latine chriſtianes, and punicall chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in Aphrica, of whom all vnderſtoode not the latine ſeruice.</p>
               <p>And whereas S. Auguſtine, as you alleage him, without ſhewing the place (as your maner is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you may eaſely deceiue the reader) hath theſe wordes in his ſermons to the common people di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe tymes: <hi>Nunc loquar latinè, vt omnes intelligatis,</hi> now will I ſpeake latine, that you maye all vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand me: of that ſaying, if any ſuch be, may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, that ſometymes he ſpake in the punicall tonge to the punicall chriſtianes, not vnderſtanding the latine: but now among the Latine Aphricanes, that were of the Romaine kynde, and vnderſtoode not the punike, he would ſpeake latine, that all ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:3911:71" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſhuld vnderſtand him.</p>
               <p>Who ſo deſyreth further to be perſuaded, that the people of Aphrica called <hi>Poeni,</hi> ſpake and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode theire owne punicall tonge, and not the latine tonge, as likewiſe the people of Spaigne, named <hi>Iberi,</hi> ſpake that language which was proper to them: let him reade <hi>Titus Liuius de bello Macedonico.</hi> For there he recordeth, that when thoſe of Aphrica, or of Spaigne and the Romaines came together for parle and talke: they vſed an interpreter.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Vlpianus</hi> the Lawier a great officer about <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> the Emperour, at the begynning of Chriſten Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">In l fidei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commiſſa ff. d. leg. 3.</note> writeth, that <hi>fidei commiſſa</hi> maye be lefte in all vulgare tonges. and putteth for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the Punicall and the Frenche, or rather Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call tonge.</p>
               <p>This much or more might here be ſayde of the language of the people of Gallia, now called Fraunce; which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was barbarouſe and vulgare, and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly latine, and yet had they of that nation their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice then in Latine: as all the Weſt churche had.

               <p>Theſe be teſtimonies playne and euident ynough, that at the begynning the churches of England had their diuine Seruice in Latine, and not in Engliſh. One place more I will recite out of Bede, moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt of all other, for proufe hereof. In the tyme of Agatho the Pope, there was a reuerent man called Iohn, <hi>Archicantor,</hi> that is chiefe chaunter or ſynger of S. Peters churche at Rome, and Abbot of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie of S. Martin there. Benedicte an abbot of Britaine, haui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g buylded a monaſterie at the mowth of the Riuer <hi>Murus,</hi> (Bede ſo calleth it) ſued to the Pope for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmations, liberties, frauncheſies, priuileges, etc. as in ſuch caſe hath ben accuſtomed. Among other thinges, he obteined this cunning Chaunter Iohn, to come with him into Britaine, to teache ſonge.</p>
               <p>Becauſe Bedes eccleſiaſticall ſtorye is not very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, I haue thought good, here to recite his owne wordes, thus engliſhed. This Abbot Benedicte tooke with him the foreſayd Iohn, to bring him in to Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that he ſhuld teache in his monaſtery, the courſe of ſeruice for the whole yere, ſo as it was done at S. Peters in Rome. Iohn dyd as he had commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Pope, both in teaching the ſynging men of the ſayde monaſtery the order and rite of ſynging and reading with vtterance of their voice, and alſo of writing and prycking thoſe thinges, that the compaſſe of the whole yere requyred, in the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration and keping of the holy dayes. Which be kepte in the ſame monaſterie, till this daye, and be copied out of many rownde about on euery coſte.
<pb facs="tcp:3911:74" rendition="simple:additions"/> Neither dyd that Iohn teache the brethren of that monaſtery onely, but alſo many other made all the meanes they could, to gete him to other places, where they might haue him to teache. This farre Bede. I trowe no man will thinke, that this Romaine taught and wrote the order and maner of ſynging and pronouncing the Seruice of the churches of this lande, in the Engliſh tonge.</p>
               <p>If it had ben demed of the learned and godly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of Chriſten people then a neceſſary pointe to ſaluation, to haue had the ſeruice in the engliſh: no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had ben ſo apte and fitte to haue tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlated it, as he, who in thoſe dayes had by ſpeciall grace of God, a ſingular gifte to make ſonges and ſonets in engliſh meter, to ſerue religion and deuotion. His name was <hi>Cednom.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cednom.</note> of whom Bede writeth merueilouſe thinges. How he made diuerſe ſonges conteining matter of the holy ſcripture, with ſuch exceding ſwetenes, and with ſuch a grace, as many feeling their hartes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puncte and prickte with hearing and reading of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, withdrewe them ſelues from the loue of the world, and were enke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled with the deſyer of the heauenly lyfe. Many ſayeth Bede of th'engliſh nation attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after him to make religiouſe and godly poetries, but none could doo comparably to him. For he was not (ſayeth he alluding to S. Paules wordes) taught of men,<note place="margin">Galat. 1.</note> neither by man, that arte of making godly ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: but receiued from God that gifte freely. And therfore he could make no wanton, tryfling, or vaine ditties, but onely ſuch, as perteined to godly Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and might ſeme to procede of a head guyded
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3911:74"/> by the holy ghoſt. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. This diuine poet <hi>Cednom,</hi> though he made many and ſundry holy workes, hauing their whole argument out of holy ſcripture, as Bede reporteth: yet neuer made he any piece of the Seruice to be vſed in the churche. Thus the faith hath continewed in this land among the Engliſh people, from the 14. yere of the reigne of <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Emperour, almoſt theſe thouſand yeres,<note place="margin">The firſt entree of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</note> and vntill the late king Edwardes tyme, the Engliſh Seruice was neuer heard of, at leaſt waye neuer in the churche of England by publike auctoritie receiued and vſed.</p>
               <p>Now touching the ſcripture by M. Iuell, and by all them of that ſyde alleaged, for the Seruice to be had in the vulgare tonge. In the 14. chapter of the firſt epiſtle to the Corinthians, S. Paul treateth of the vſe of tonges, ſo as it was in the primitiue churche a ſpeciall gifte. As the faithfull folke came together to pray and to heare gods worde, ſome one man ſuddeinly ſtoode vp, and ſpake in the congregation with tonges of many nations, <hi>Spiritu inſuſurrante,</hi> as Chryſoſtom ſayeth, that is, by inſpiration or prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting of the ſpirite, ſo, as neither others that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, neither him ſelfe, after the opinion of Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, vnderſtoode, what he ſayd: That gifte the Apoſtle dyd not forbyd. For that euery gifte of God is good, and nothing by him done in vaine: but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the Corinthians fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vaine and ambitiouſe vſe of it, and therefore dyd much extenuate the ſame, and preferred prophecying, that is the gifte to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete and expounde ſcriptures, farre before it. It
<pb facs="tcp:3911:75" rendition="simple:additions"/> was not in the churche, but in the Apoſtles tyme, or a very ſhorte while after them, and that all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by miracle, the holy ghoſt being the worker of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The place of S. Paul to the Co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rinthians maketh not for the Serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce in the Engliſh tonge.</note>As concernig the order of the common prayers and publike Seruice, in ſuch ſorte as we haue now, and that age had not: S. Paul mentioneth nothing, neither ſpeaheth one word in that whole chapter, but of the vſe of the miraculouſe gifte, as is ſayde before. And therefore his ſayinges out of that chapter, be not fittely alleaged of M. Iuell and the reſte of our aduerſaries, againſt the maner of prayers and Seruice of the churche now receiued and of long tyme vſed, which in the Weſt is vttered in the latine tonge, not by waye of miracle or peculiar gifte, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the inſtitution and ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the churche. <hi>Profectò enim coelu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Eccleſia tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fuit.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In 1. Cor. 14. ho. 37.</note> In very dede ſayeth Chryſoſtome, the churche then was a heauen, when as the holy ghoſt adminiſtred all thinges, modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the headdes of the churche, caughte eche one with his inſpiration. As for now, we kepe but the ſteppes onely of thoſe thinges. We ſpeake two or three of vs, and that a ſundre, and one holding his peace, an other begynneth. But theſe be but ſignes onely and memorials of thinges. And ſo when we haue begonne, (he meaneth <hi>Dominus vobiſcum) &amp; cum ſpiritu tuo,</hi> the people anſwereth: meaning to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie thereby, that ſo in olde tyme they ſpake, not of their owne wiſedome, but of the inſtincte of the ſpirite of God. This much Chryſoſtome of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly maner of the primitiue churche in the Apoſtles
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:3911:75"/> tyme. Now if in theſe dayes the maner were like, if it pleaſed the holy ghoſt to powre vpon vs the like abundance of grace, as to doo all thinges for vs, to rule the headdes of all faithfull people, to carrie eche one of vs with his diuine inſpiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we came to churche together for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte and edifying, to geue in to our hartes and put in to our mowthes by daily miracle, what we ſhuld praye, and what we ſhuld preache, and how we ſhuld ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dle the ſcriptures: In this caſe no catholike chriſten man would allowe the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitefull ſpeaking with ſtraunge and vnknowen tonges without interpretation, to the lette and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of gods word to be declared, and to the keping of the people onely in gaſing and wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, from ſaying <hi>Amen,</hi> and geuing their aſſent to the godly bleſsing and thankes geuing. But the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the churche now is farre otherwiſe. We haue not thoſe miraculouſe giftes, and right well maye we doo with out them. For the ſpeaking with tonges, was in ſtede of a ſigne or wonder, not to them that beleued, but to the vnbeleuers. And ſignes be for the vnfaithfull, the faithfull haue no neede of them. In churches, I meane where auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t order is kepte, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les the Seruice is ſong or ſayd, the miniſters doo not ſpeake with tonges, or with a tonge, in ſuch ſorte as S. Paul vnderſtoode: but they doo reade and rehearſe thinges ſet forth and appointed to them. S. Paul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buketh them, who ſpeaking with tonges, letted the preachers, ſo as the people preſent might not be edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed. The Latine Seruice is not ſo done in the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, as the expoſition of the ſcriptures be thereby
<pb facs="tcp:3911:76" rendition="simple:additions"/> excluded. In the Apoſtles tyme, they came to chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, to th'intent they might profitably exerciſe the giftes God gaue them, and by the ſame, ſpecially by the gifte of prophecying, edifie one an other, and teache one an other. Now adayes they come not to churche together one to teache an other, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde the ſcriptures in common: but to praye, and to heare the opening of Gods word, not one of an other with out order, but of ſome one, to witte, the biſhop, prieſt, curate, or other ſpirituall gouernour and teacher. And for as much as all the people can not heare the prieſtes prayers at th'aulter (which hath from the Apoſtles tyme hytherto euer ben a place to celebrate the holy oblation at) tourning him ſelfe for the moſt parte to the Eaſt, according to Apoſtolike tradition, in what tonge ſo euer they be vttered, for diſtance of the place they remaine in: it is no inconuenience, ſuch admitted in to the quyer, as haue better vnderſtanding of that is ſayd or ſong: that the reſte remaine in ſemely wiſe in the neather parte of the churche, and there make their humble prayers to God, by them ſelues in ſilence, in that language, they beſt vnderſtand, conforming them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to the prieſtes bleſsing and thankes geuing through faith and obedience with their brethren in the quyer, and geuing aſſent to the ſame, vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſome good parte of that is done, as declared by often preaching, and by holy outward ceremonies, perceiueable to the ſenſes of the ſimpleſt.</p>

Which Caluine him ſelfe ſytting in iudgement as it were vpon this doubtefull matter, alloweth beſt, and condemneth the mynde of all others, and alſo his owne, though vnwares, as it ſemeth and ſo he would
<pb facs="tcp:3911:77" rendition="simple:additions"/> condemne your noyſe of ſtraunge wordes likewiſe, if he heard it. This texte being ſo doubtefull of it ſelfe in ſenſe, ſo put out of tune by your noyſe of ſtraunge wordes, wherewith you deſcant vpon the worde <hi>Spirite,</hi> ſo violently applyed by your newe fangled expoſition, maketh litle to the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the latine Seruice in the latine churche: ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeing that S. Paul meaneth by that miraculouſe ſpeaking with tonges, vſed or rather abuſed among the Corinthians, a farre different maner of ſpeaking from that ſpeaking, whereby the prieſt vttereth the common Seruice.</p>
               <p>The prieſt (I graunt) ſaying his Seruice to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, ſpeaketh with a tonge, but ſuch maner of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king is not that, which S. Paul meant. For the prieſt vnderſtandeth it for the better parte, if he be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the people be not vtterly ignorant, becauſe of often preaching, long cuſtome, ſolemne feaſtes and ſundry ceremonies. And therefore your argument gathered out of that texte, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth nothing againſt hauing the Seruice in the learned latine tonge not perfitely vnderſtanded of the vnlearned people.</p>
               <p>Verely if you admitte the exacte iudgement of S. Auguſtine concerning this place of S. Paul,<note place="margin">vide Aug. lib. 12. de Geneſi ad litera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. c. 7. 8. &amp; 9. to. 3</note> then muſt you ſeeke for other ſcriptures and proufes of your Engliſh Seruice. For as he diſcuſſeth this point learnedly, by the <hi>tonge S. Paul</hi> meaneth not the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Greke, or Hebrewe amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the vnlearned people, or any other alien or ſtraunge tonge: but onely, and that by waye of metaphore, any maner of vttera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, whereby the ſignes of thinges are pronounced, before
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3911:77"/> they be vnderſtanded. And by the <hi>Spirite,</hi> he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth not a noyſe of ſtraunge wordes, after your ſtraunge interpretation, but, as it is here in a certaine proper and peculiar maner taken, a power of the ſoule inferiour to the mynde, which conceiueth the ſimilitudes of thinges, and vnderſtandeth them not. And thinges ſo vttered, be vttered with <hi>the tonge</hi> and <hi>ſpirite,</hi> whether it be in Engliſhe or Latine, or any other language.</p>
               <p>And Syr, although the people vnderſtand not in moſt exacte wiſe, what the prieſt ſayeth in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine ſeruice, yet haue they commoditie and profite therby, ſo farre as it pleaſeth God to accepte the common prayer of the churche, pronounced by the prieſt for them.</p>
               <p>But S. Paul (ſaye they) requyreth that the people geue aſſent, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme them ſelues vnto the prieſt, by anſwering <hi>Amen</hi> to his prayer made in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. Verely in the Primitiue churche this was neceſſary, when the faith was a learning. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the prayers were made then in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon tonge knowen to the people, for cauſe of their further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction who being of late conuerted to the faith, and of paynimes made chriſtians, had nede in all thinges to be taught. But after that the faithfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was multiplied and increaced in great numbers, and had ben ſo well inſtructed in all pointes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as by their owne accorde they conformed them ſelues to the miniſters at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prayers: in the Latine churche the Seruice was ſet out in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and it was thought ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, parte of the people
<pb facs="tcp:3911:78" rendition="simple:additions"/> in the quyer, to anſwere for the whole people. And this hath ben eſtemed for a more expedite and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient order, then if it were in the vulgare tonge of euery nation.</p>
               <p>I graunt they can not ſaye <hi>Amen</hi> to the bleſsing or thankeſ-geuing of the prieſt, ſo well as if they vnderſtoode the Latine to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge perfitely. Yet they geue aſſent to it, and ratifie it in their hartes, and doo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them ſelues vnto the prieſt, though not in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, yet in generall: that is to witte, though not in euery particular ſentence of praiſe and thankes-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, or in euery ſeuerall petition, yet in the whole. For if they come to churche with a right and good intent, as the ſimple doo, no leſſe then the learned: their deſyre is to render vnto god glorie, praiſe and honour, and to thanke him for benefites receiued, and with all, to obteine of him thinges behofull for them in this life, and in the life to come. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubte this godly affection of their myndes, is ſo acceptable to God, as no vnderſtanding of wordes may be compared with it. This requyſite aſſent and conforming of them ſelues to the prieſt, they declare by ſundry outward tokens and geſtures: as by ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp at the goſpell and at the preface of the Maſſe, by bowing them ſelues downe and adoring at the Sacrament, by kneeling at other tymes, as when par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and mercie is humbly aſked, and by other like ſignes of deuotion, in other partes of the Seruice.</p>
               <p>And whereas S. Paul ſemeth to diſallowe praying with tonges in the common aſſemble, becauſe of want of edifying, and to eſteme the vtterance of fyue
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3911:78"/> wordes or ſentences with vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that the reſte might be inſtructed thereby, more then ten thouſand wordes in a ſtraunge and vnknowen tonge: all this is to be referred to the ſtate of that tyme, which was much vnlike the ſtate of the churche we be now in. The to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of the prayers which S. Paul ſpeaketh of, was vtterly ſtraunge and vnknowen, and ſerued for a ſigne to the vnbeleuers. The latine tonge in the latine churche is not all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſtraunge and vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For beſyde the prieſt, in moſt places ſome of the reſte haue vnderſtanding of it, more or leſſe, and now we haue no nede of any ſuch ſigne. They needed inſtruction: we be not ignorant of the chiefe pointes of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They were to be taught in all thinges: we come not to churche ſpecially and chiefly to be thaught at the Seruice, but to praye, and to be taught by preaching. Their prayer was not vaileable for lacke of faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was it to be made in the vulgare tonge, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creace of faith. Our faith will ſtand vs in better ſtede, if we geue our ſelues to deuout prayer. They for lacke of faith, had nede of interpretation, bothe in prayers, and alſo in preaching, and all other ſpirituall exerciſes. We hauing ſufficient inſtruction in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary rudimentes of our faith, for the reſte, haue more nede by earneſt and feruent prayer, to make ſute vnto God, for an vpright pure and holy lyfe, then to ſpende much tyme in hearing for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Concerning which thing, Chryſoſtome hath this ſaying. <hi>Profectò ſi orare cum diligentia inſueſcas,</hi>

If all prayers made in an vnknowen tonge be a mocking of God, as Beza ſayeth: then were the prayers vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by miracle in the primitiue churche with ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges (which the vtterers them ſelues vnderſtoode not, after the mynde of Chryſoſtome) a mocking of god: for I ſee nothing, whereby they are excluded from his generall ſaying and vniuerſall propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

And therefore he exhorteth them to learne the meaning of them at his preaching, leaſt they ſhuld ſyng not with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine reaſon, (as is before recited) but with voyce onely, as byrdes doo.</p>
               <p>The reſte of the ſcriptures whereof the Seruice conſiſteth, is, though not all together ſo obſcure as the pſalmes, yet veryly darker and harder, then that the common peoples groſſe and ſimple wittes may pearce the vndeſtanding of it, by hearing the ſame pronounced of the miniſter in their mother tonge.

For where as the churche, and all that is of the chuch, is Chriſtes, as well for other cauſes, as ſpecially for that we are bought with a great price, euen with his bloude as S. Paul ſayeth:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note> how can it perteine to any other, then to him, to inſtitute and appoint to him ſelfe a vicare, that is, one, to doe his ſteede? Wherefore to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, excepte we would wickedly graunt, that gods prouidence hath lacked, or doth lacke to his churche, for loue of which he hath geuen his onely begotten ſonne, and which he hath promiſed neuer to forgete, ſo as the woman can not forgete the chylde ſhe bare in her wombe: Reaſon may ſone enduce vs to beleue, that to one man, one biſhop, the chiefe and higheſt of all biſhops, the ſucceſſour of Peter, the rule and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement of the church, by God hath ben deferred. For elles if God had ordeyned, that in in the church ſhuld be ſundry heades and rulers, and none conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to be ouer other, but all of equall power, ech one among their people: then he ſhuld ſeme to haue ſet vp ſo many churches, as he hath appointed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours. And ſo he ſhall appeare to haue brought in among his faithfull people, that vnruly confuſion, the deſtruction of all common weales, ſo much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
<pb facs="tcp:3911:91" rendition="simple:additions"/> of princes, which the grekes call <hi>Anarchian,</hi> which is a ſtate for lacke of order in gouernours, without any gouernement at all. Which thing, ſith that the wiſe and politike men of this worlde doo ſhunne and deteſt in the gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of theſe earthly kingdomes, as moſt perniciouſe and hurtfull, to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the high wiſdome of God, and to our lord Chriſt, who is the auctor of the moſt ordinate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of all thinges in earth and in heauen: it were heynous and prophane impietie. Wherefore if the ſtate of a kingdome can not continew ſafe, onleſſe one haue power to rule, how ſhall not the church ſpredde ſo farre abroade, be in danger of great diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, corruption, and vtter deſtruction, if, as occaſion ſhalbe geuen, among ſo great ſtrifes and debates of men, among ſo many fyerbrandes of diſcord toſſed to and fro by the deuils, enemies of vnitie: there be not one head and ruler, of all to be conſulted, of all to be hearde, of all to be folowed and obeied? If ſtrife and contentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſtirred about matters of faith, if controuerſie happen to riſe about the ſenſe of the ſcriptures, ſhall it not be neceſſary, there be one ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme iudge, to whoſe ſentence the parties may ſtande? If nede require (as it hath ben often ſene) that generall councelles be kepte, how can the biſhops, to whom that matter belongeth, be brought together, but by commaundement of one head gouernour, whom they owe their obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto? For elles being ſummoned perhappes they will not come. Finally how ſhall the contumacie, and pertinacie of miſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous perſones be repreſſed, ſpecially if the biſhops
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3911:91"/> be at diſcenſion with in them ſelues: if there be not a ſupreme power, who towardes ſome may vſe the rodde, towardes other ſome the ſpirite of lenitie, with ſuch diſcrete temperament, as malice be vanquiſhed, right defended, and concorde procured: leaſt, if the ſmall ſparkes of ſtrife be not quenched by auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie at the beginning, at length a great flame of ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and hereſies flaſhe abrode, to the great da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of a multitude? Therefore as there is one body of Chriſt, one flocke, one church, euen ſo is there one head of that his myſticall body, one ſhepeherd and one chiefe ſeruant made ſteward, ouerſeer, and ruler ouer Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes houſeholde in his abſence, vntill his comming againe.<note place="margin">The 6. proufe, practiſe of the churche, ſyxfolde.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But here perhappes ſome will ſaie, it can not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the euente of thinges and practiſe of the church, that the Pope had this ſupreme power and auctoritie ouer all biſhops, and ouer all Chriſtes flocke in matters touching faith, and in cauſes eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall.

And here I might alleage firſt, certaine places of the newe teſtament, declaring that Peter practiſed this preeminence among the diſciples at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and that they yelded the ſame, as of right apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining vnto him.<note place="margin">Act. 1.</note> As when he firſt and onely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them to chooſe one in the ſtede of Iudas, and demeaned him ſelfe, as the chiefe autctor of all that was done therein: when he made anſwere for all,<note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> at what time they were gaſed and wondered at, and of

               <p>But becauſe our aduerſaries doo wreath and wreſte the ſcriptures (be they neuer ſo plaine) by there pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, and ſtraunge conſtructions, to an vnderſtanding quite contrary to the ſenſe of the catholike church: I will referre the reader for further proufe of this matter, to the ſtories bearing faithfull witnes of the whole ſtate and condition of the church in all ages.

For peruſing the eccleſiaſticall ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with writinges of the fathers, beſyde many other thinges perteining hereto, we finde theſe practiſes, for declaration of this ſpeciall auctoritie and power. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, that biſhops of euery nation haue made their appeale in their weighty affaires to the Pope, and allwayes haue ſued to the See Apoſtolike, as well for ſuccour and helpe againſt violence, iniuries &amp; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as for redreſſe of other diſorders. Alſo, that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:3911:92"/> the malice of wicked perſons hath ben repreſſed and chaſtiſed of that auctoritie by excommunication, eiection, and expulſion out of their dignities and romes, and by other cenſures of the church. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that the ordinations and elections of biſhops of all prouinces, haue ben confirmed by the Pope. Beſide this, that the approuing and diſalowing of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> councelles haue perteined to him. Item, that biſhops <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> wrongfully co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned and depriued by councelles, by him haue ben aſſoiled and reſtored to their chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches againe. Laſtly, that biſhops and patriarkes after <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> longe ſtrifes and contentions, haue at length vpon better aduiſe, ben reconcilied vnto him againe.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Pope.</note> for the appellation of biſhops to the See <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Apoſtolike, beſide many oher, we haue the knowen examples of Athanaſius that worthy biſhop of Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandria, and lighte of the worlde: who hauing ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteined great and fundry wronges at the Arianes, appealed firſt, to Iulius the Pope, and after his death, to Felix: of Chriſoſtome, who appealed to Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, againſt the violence of Theophilus: of Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus, who appealed to Leo. Neither made biſhops onely their appeale to the Pope by their delegates, but alſo in certaine caſes, being cited, appeared before him in their owne perſons. Which is plainely gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Theodoritus his eccleſiaſticall ſtorye, who writeth thus. Euſebius biſhop of Nicomedia (who was the chiefe pillour of the Arianes) and they that ioyned with him in that factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, falſly accuſed Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius to Iulius the B. of Rome. Iulius folowing the eccleſiaſticall rule, commaunded them to come to
<pb facs="tcp:3911:93" rendition="simple:additions"/> Rome, and cauſed the reuerent Athanaſius to be ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to iudgement, <hi>regulariter,</hi> after the order of the cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. He came. The falſe accuſers went not to Rome, knowing righte well that theire forged lye might eaſely be deprehended.</p>
               <p>In the cauſe and defence of Ihon Chryſoſtome, theſe biſhops came from Conſtantinople, to Innocentius the Pope, Panſophus B. of Piſidia, Pappus of Syria, Demetrius of the ſeconde Galatia, and Eugenius of Phrygia. Theſe were ſuters for Chryſoſtome. He him ſelfe treated his matter with Innocentius by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. In his epiſtle among other thinges, he writeth thus. Leaſt this outragious confuſion runne ouer all, and beare rule euery where, write (I pray you) and determine by your auctoritie, ſuch wicked actes done in our abſence, and when we withdrewe not our ſelues from iudgement, to be of no force, as by theire owne nature truly they be voied, and vtterly none. Furthermore who haue committed theſe euil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, put you them vnder the cenſure of the church. And as for vs, ſith that we are innocent, neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicte, neither fownde in any defaulte, nor proued gyltie of any crime: geue commaundement, that we be reſtored to our churches agayne, that we may enioye the accuſtomed charitie and peace with our brethren. Innocentius after that he vnderſtoode the whole matter, pronounced and decreed the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Theophilus, that was againſt Chryſoſtome, to be voyed, and of no force. This whole tragedie is at large ſet forth by Palladius B. of <hi>Helenopolis, in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Ioannis Chryſoſtomi,</hi> who lyued at that tyme. By this
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:3911:93"/> appeale of Chryſoſtome, and by the whole hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the matter, and ſpecially by the purporte of his epiſtle to Innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius, the ſuperioritie of the Pope, is euidently acknowleged. And ſo is it plainely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by Athanaſius, and the biſhops of Egipte, Thebais and Libya, aſſembled in councell at Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, by theſe wordes of their epiſtle to Felix. <hi>Veſtru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt enim nobis manum porrigere, etc.</hi> It is your parte (ſaie they) to ſtretche forth your helping ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de vnto vs, becauſe we are committed vnto you. It is your parte to defende vs, and deliuer vs, it is our parte to ſeeke helpe of you, and to obey your commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. And a litle after. For we knowe that you beare the cure and charge of the vniuerſall church, and ſpecially of biſhops, who in reſpecte of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and ſpeculation, are called the eyes of our lord, as alwaies the prelates of your See, firſt the Apoſtles, then theire ſucceſſours, haue done.</p>
               <p>Theodoritus that learned B. of Cyrus, beſyde the epiſtle he wrote to Leo for ſuccour and helpe in his troubles, in an other, that he wrote to Renatus a prieſt neare about Leo, ſayeth thus. <hi>Spoliarunt me ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotio etc.</hi> They haue violently robbed me of my biſhoprike, they haue caſte me foorth of the cities, neither hauing reuerenced myne age ſpente in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor my hoare heares. Wherefore I beſeche thee, that thou perſuade the moſt holy Archebiſhop (he meaneth Leo) to vſe his apoſtolike auctoritie, and to commaunde vs to come vnto your councell or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtorie. For this holy See holdeth the rudther, and hath the gouernement of the churches of the whole
<pb facs="tcp:3911:94" rendition="simple:additions"/> worlde, partly for other reſpectes, but ſpecially, for that it hath euermore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinewed cleare fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtintche of hereſie, and that none euer ſate in it, who was of contrary opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but rather hath euer kepte the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike grace, vndefyled. In which wordes of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doritus, this is chiefly to be marked, that the holy See of Rome (as he ſayeth) hath the gouernement of the churches of all the worlde, moſt for this cauſe, that it was neuer infected with hereſie, as all other churches fownded by the Apoſtles were.</p>
               <p>For which cauſe, that See hath euer hitherto of all chriſten nations, and now alſo ought to be hearde and obeyed in all pointes of faith. For that See though it hath failed ſometymes in charitie, and hath ben in caſe as it might truly ſaye the wordes of the goſpell, ſpoken by the fooliſhe virgins,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>our lampes be without lighte:</hi> yet it neuer failed in faith, as Theodoritus wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, and S. Auguſtine affirmeth the ſame. Which ſpeciall grace and ſingulare priuiledge, is to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnto the prayer of Chriſt, by which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined of God for Peter and his ſucceſſours,<note place="margin">Euill lyfe of the B. of Rome: ought not to ſeuer vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faith of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of Rome.</note> that their faith ſhuld not fayle. Therfore the euill lyfe of the biſhops of Rome ought not to withdrawe vs from beleuing and folowing the doctrine preached and taughte in the holy churche of Rome.</p>
               <p>For better credite hereof, that is earneſtly to be conſidered, which S. Auguſtine writeth <hi>epiſtola</hi> 165. where, after that he hath rehearſed in order all the Popes that ſucceded Peter, euen to him that was Pope in his tyme, he ſayeth thus. <hi>In illum ordinem epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcoporum etc.</hi> In to that rewe of biſhops, that reacheth
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:3911:94"/> from Peter him ſelfe to Anaſtaſius, which now ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the ſame chaier, if any traitour had crepte in, it ſhuld nothing hurte the church, and the innocent chriſten folke, ouer whom our lord hauing proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſayeth of euill rulers: <hi>what they ſaye vnto you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>doo ye, but what they doo, doo ye not, for they ſaye, and doo not:</hi> to the intent the hope of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full perſon may be certaine, and ſuch, as being ſet not in man, but in our lord, be neuer ſcattered abroade with tempeſt of wicked ſchiſme. And in his 166. epiſtle, (he ſayeth) our heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly Maiſter hath ſo farre forewarned vs, to be ware of all euill of diſſenſion, that he aſſured the people alſo of euill rulers, that for their ſakes, the Seate of holeſom doctrine ſhuld not be forſaken, in which Seate, euen the very euill men be compelled to ſaye good thinges. For the thinges which they ſaye, be not theires, but gods, who in the Seate of vnitie, hath put the doctrine of veritie.</p>
               <p>By this we are plainely taught, that albe it the ſucceſſours of Peter Chriſtes vicares in earth, be fownde blameworthy for euill lyfe, yet we oughte not to diſſente from them in doctrine, nor ſeuer our ſelues from them in faith. For as much as, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they be euill, by gods prouidence for the ſuertie of his people, they be compelled to ſaie the thinges that be good, and to teache the truth, the thinges they ſpeake, not being theirs, but gods, who hath put the doctrine of veritie in the Seate or chaier of vnitie: which ſingulare grace cometh ſpecially to the See of Peter, either of the force of Chriſtes prayer,
<pb facs="tcp:3911:95" rendition="simple:additions"/> as is ſayde before, or in reſpecte of place and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which the biſhops of that See holde for Chriſt, as Balaam could be broughte by no meanes to curſe that people, whom God would to be bleſſed. And Caiphas alſo prophecied, becauſe he was high biſhop of that yere, and prophecied truly, being a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe moſt wicked. And therfore the euill doinges of biſhops of Rome make no argument of diſcrediting their doctrine. To this purpoſe the example of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie Nazianzene may very fittely be applied, of the golden, ſyluerne, and leadden ſeale. As touching the valewe of metalles, golde and ſyluer are better, but for the goodnes of the ſeale, as well doth leadde imprint a figure in waxe, as ſyluer or golde. For this cauſe, that the See of Rome hath neuer ben defyled with ſtinking hereſies, as Theodoritus ſayeth, and god hath alwaies kepte in that chaier of vnitie, the doctrine of veritie, as Auguſtine writeth: for this cauſe (I ſaye) it ſitteth at the ſterne, and gouerneth the churches of the whole worlde, for this cauſe biſhops haue made their appellations thither, iudgement in doubtes of doctrine, and determination in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies and ſtrifes, hath ben from thence alwayes demaunded.</p>
               <p>Now that the B. of Rome had alwayes cure and rule ouer all other biſhops, ſpecially of them of the Eaſt (for touching them of the Weſt church it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed) beſyde a hundred other euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, this is one very ſufficient, that he had in the Eaſt to doo his ſtede, three delegates or vicares, now commonly they be named legates. And this for the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:3911:95"/> commoditie of the biſhops there, whoſe churches were farre diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome. The one was the biſhop of Conſtantinople, as we finde it mencioned <hi>in epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stola Simplicij ad Achatium Constantinopolitanum.</hi> The ſeconde was the biſhop of Alexandria, as the epiſtle of Bonifacius the ſeconde to Eulalius, recordeth. The third was the biſhop of Theſſalonica, as it is at large declared in the 82. epiſtle of <hi>Leo ad Anaſtaſium Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonicenſem.</hi> By peruſing theſe epiſtles euery man may ſee, that all the biſhops of Grece, Aſia, Syria, Egi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, and to be ſhorte of all the Orient, rendred and exhibited their humble obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the B. of Rome, and to his arbitreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t referred their doubtes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and cauſes, and to him onely made theire appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>

This being fownde true for the fower firſt chiefe councelles, we nede not to ſay any thinge of the reſt, that folowed.

Sundry the like reconciliations of the patriarkes of Alexandria and Ieruſalem to the See of Rome in like caſes, might eaſely be recited, which for auoiding of tediouſneſſe I paſſe ouer, as likewiſe of the patriarkes of Conſtantinople, which as we reade in auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſtories, haue forſaken the church of Rome twelue tymes, and haue ben reconcilied to the ſame againe.</p>

Leo that worthy B. of Rome, was called the vniuerſall Biſhop and vniuerſall patriarke, of ſyx hundred and thirty fathers aſſembled together from all partes of the world in generall councell at Chalcedon. Which is both expreſſed in that councell, and alſo clearly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by S. Gregory in three ſundry epiſtles, to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:3911:99"/> Mauricius the Emperour, to Eulogius Patriarke of Alexandria, and to Anaſtaſius Patriarke of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioche. Thus that name was deferred vnto the Pope by the fathers of that great councell, which by them had not ben done, had it ben vnlawfull. In ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dede neither Leo him ſelfe, nor any other his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour euer called or wrote himſelfe, by that name, as S.

But rather vſed the name of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, calling them ſelues ech one <hi>Seruum ſeruorum Dei,</hi> the ſeruant of the ſeruantes of God. Yet ſundry holy martyrs biſhops of Rome vſed to calle them ſelues biſhops of the vniuerſall church, which in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte is the ſame, as the fathers of Chalcedon vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode. So did Sixtus in the tyme of Adrianus the Emperour in his epiſtle to the biſhops of all the world. So dyd Victor writing to Theophilus of Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandria.

And all theſe were before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine the great, and before the councell of Nice, which times our aduerſaries acknowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to haue ben without corruption. The ſame title was vſed likewiſe after the Nicene councell, by Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix, by Leo, and by diuerſe others, before the firſt ſix hundred yeres after Chriſt were expired.

               <p>I will adde to all that hath ben hytherto ſayde of this matter, a ſaying of Martin Luther, that ſuch as doo litle regarde the grauitie of auncient fathers of the olde church, may yet ſomewhat be moued with the lightnes of the young father Luther, Patriarke and fownder of their newe churche.

Neque enim ſine vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate Dei in hanc monarchiam vnquam venire potuiſſet Rom. Pontifex. At voluntas Dei quoquo modo nota fuerit, cum reuerentia ſuſcipienda eſt, ideoque non licet temerè Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mano pontifici in ſuo primatu reſiſtere. Haec autem ratio tanta eſt, vt ſi etiam nulla ſcriptura, nulla alia cauſa eſſet,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:3911:103"/> haec tamen ſatis eſſet ad compeſcendam temeritatem reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentium.

Nam &amp; apud theologos omnes voluntas ſigni, quam vocant operationem Dei, non minus quàm alia ſigna voluntatis Dei, vt praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pta prohibitiua etc. metuenda eſt. Ideo non video, quomodo ſint excuſati à ſchiſmatis reatu, qui huic voluntati contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, ſeſe à Romani pontificis auctoritate ſubtrahunt. Ecce haec eſt vna prima mihi inſuperabilis ratio, quae me ſubijcit Romano pontifici, &amp; Primatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eius confiteri cogit.</hi> The firſt thing that moueth me to thinke the B. of Rome to be ouer all other, that we knowe to be biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, is the very will of God, which we ſee in the facte or dede it ſelfe. for without the will of God, the B. of Rome could neuer haue commen vnto this monarchie. But the will of God, by what meane ſo euer it be knowen, is to be receiued reuerently. And therefore it is not lawfull raſhly to reſiſte the B. of Rome in his primacie. And this is ſo great a reaſon for the ſame, that if there were no ſcripture at all, nor other reaſon: yet this were ynough to ſtay the raſhnes of them, that reſiſte. And through this onely reaſon the moſt gloriouſe martyr Cyprian in many of his epiſtles vaunteth him ſelfe very boldly againſt all the aduerſaries of Biſhops, what ſoeuer they were. As in the thirde booke of the kinges we read, that the ten tribes of Iſrael departed from Roboam Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb facs="tcp:3911:104" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne. Yeat becauſe it was done by the will or auctoritie of God, it ſtoode in effecte with God. For among all the diuines, the will of the ſigne, which they call the working of God, is to be feared no leſſe, then other ſignes of Gods will, as commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes prohibitiue, etc. Therefore, I ſee not, how they may be excuſed of the gilte of ſchiſme, which going againſt this will, withdrawe them ſelues from the auctoritie of the B. of Rome. Lo this is one chiefe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible reaſon, that maketh me to be vnder the biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome, and compelleth me to confeſſe his Primacie.

               <p>Thus I haue briefly touched ſome deale of the ſcriptures, of the canons and councells, of the edictes of Emperours, of the fathers ſayinges, of the reaſons, and of the manifolde practiſes of the church, which are wonte to be alleaged for the Popes Primacie and ſupreme auctoritie.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſten people hath euer ben taught, that the body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt by the vnſpeakeable working of the grace of God and vertue of the holy Ghoſte, is preſent in this moſt holy Sacrament, and that verely and in dede. This doctrine is fownded vppon the plaine wordes of Chriſt, which he vttered in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this ſacrament, expreſſed by the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtes, and by S. Paul. As they were at ſupper (ſayeth Matthewe) <hi>Ieſus tooke breade and bleſſed it, and brake it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 26</note> 
                  <hi>and gaue it to his diſciples, and ſayeth: Take ye, eate ye, this is my body. And takyng the cuppe, he gaue thankes, and gaue it to them, ſaying: Drynke ye all of this: For this is my bloude of the newe teſtament, which ſhall be ſhedde for many in remiſsion of ſynnes.</hi> With like wordes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Marke, Luke and Paul,<note place="margin">Marc. 14. Luc. 22. 1. Cor. 11.</note> doo deſcribe this diuine inſtitution. Neither ſayde our lord onely, <hi>This is my body,</hi> but leaſt ſome ſhuld doubte, how his wordes are to be vnderſtanded: for a playne declaration of them, he addeth this further, (<hi>Wich ys geuen for you.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luc. 22.</note> Likewiſe of the cuppe he ſayeth not onely, <hi>This is my bloude,</hi> But alſo, as it were to putte it out of all doubte: <hi>Which ſhall be ſhed for many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as faithful people doo beleue, that Chriſt ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue not a figure of his body, but his owne true and
<pb facs="tcp:3911:105" rendition="simple:additions"/> very body in ſubſtance, and like wiſe not a figure of his bloude, but his very pretiouſe bloude it ſelfe at his paſsion and death on the croſſe for our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption: ſo they beleue alſo, that the wordes of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this Sacrament, admitte no other vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, but that he geueth vnto vs in theſe holy my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, his ſelfe ſame body, and his ſelfe ſame bloude in truth of ſubſtance, which was crucified and ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de foorth for vs. Thus to the humble beleuers ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it ſelfe miniſtreth ſufficient argument of the truth of Chriſtes body and bloude in the ſacrament againſt the ſacramentaries, who holde opinion, that it is there but in a figure, ſigne, or taken onely.</p>
               <p>Againe, we can not fynde where our lord perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the promiſe he made in the ſyxth chapter of Iohn, <hi>The bread which I wil geue, is my fleſhe, which I will geue for the lyfe of the worlde:</hi> but onely in his laſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per. where if he gaue his fleſhe to his Apoſtles, and that none other, but the very ſame, which he gaue for the lyfe of the worlde: it foloweth that in the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament is not mere bread, but that ſame his very body in ſubſtance. For it was not mere bread, but his very body, that was geuen and offred vp v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the croſſe.</p>
               <p>If the wordes ſpoken by Chriſt in S. Iohn of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that he performed in his holy ſupper, <hi>The bread that I will geue, is my fleſhe,</hi> had ben to be taken not as they ſeme to meane plainely and truly, but meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically, tropically, ſymbolically and figuratiuely, ſo as the truth of our lordes fleſhe be excluded, as our aduerſaries do vnderſtand them: then the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaites
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3911:105"/> had not had any occaſion at all of their great offence. Then ſhuld not they haue had cauſe to murmour againſt Chriſt, as the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſt ſheweth: <hi>The Iewes</hi> (ſayeth S. Iohn) <hi>Stroue among them ſelues,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>ſaying: how can he geue vs his fleſhe to eate?</hi> And much leſſe his dere diſciples, to whom he had ſhewed ſo many and ſo great miracles, to whom he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared ſo many parables and ſo high ſecretes, ſhuld haue had any occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of offence. And doubte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les if Chriſt had meant, they ſhuld eate but the ſigne or figure of his body, they would not haue ſayde, <hi>Durus est hic ſermo, this is a hard ſaying, and who can abyde to heare it?</hi> For then ſhuld they haue done no greater thing, then they had done oftentymes before in eating the Eaſter lambe. And how could it ſeme a hard worde or ſaying, if Chriſt had meant nothing elles, but this, the bread that I will geue, is a figure of my body, that ſhall cauſe you to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me?</p>
               <p>To conclude ſhortely. If Chriſt would ſo haue ben vnderſtanded, as though he had meant to geue but a figure onely of his body, it had ben no nede for him to haue alleaged his omnipotencie and almighty po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to his diſciples, thereby the rather to bring them to beleefe of his true body to be geuen them to eate. <hi>Hoc vos ſcandalizet? doth this offende you, ſayeth he. what if ye ſee the ſonne of man aſcende where he was before? it is the Spirite that geueth lyfe, &amp;c.</hi> As though he had ſayde: ye conſyder onely my humanitie, that ſemeth weake and fraile, neither doo you eſteme my diuine power by the great miracles I haue wrought:
<pb facs="tcp:3911:106" rendition="simple:additions"/> But when as ye ſhall ſee me by power of my god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed aſcend in to heauen, from whence I came vnto you, will ye then alſo ſtand in doubte, whether ye-may beleue, that I geue you my very body to be eaten? Thus by ſignifyyng his diuine power, Chriſt confownded their vnbeleefe, touching the veritie and ſubſtance of his body, that he promyſed to geue them in meate.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to vſe theſe termes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially, corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp;c.</note>Theſe places of the ſcripture, and many other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting plainely, that Chriſt at his ſupper gaue to his diſciples his very body, euen that ſame which the daye folowing ſuffered death on the Croſſe, haue miniſtred iuſt cauſe to the godly and learned fathers of the churche, to ſaye, that Chriſtes body is preſent in this Sacrament really, ſubſtantially, corporally, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and naturally. By vſe of which aduerbes, they haue meant onely a truth of being, and not a waye or meane of being. And though this manner of ſpeaking be not thus expreſſed in the ſcripture, yet is it deduced out of the ſcripture. For if Chriſt ſpake plainely, and vſed no trope, figure, nor metaphore, as the ſcripture it ſelfe ſufficiently declareth to an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble beleuer, and would his diſciples to vnderſtand him, ſo as he ſpake in manifeſt termes, when he ſayde, <hi>This is my body, which is geuen for you:</hi> The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may we ſaye, that in the ſacrament his very body is preſent, yea really, that is to ſaye in dede, ſubſtantially, that is, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and corporally, carnally, and naturally: by which wordes is meant, that his very body, his very fleſhe and his very humaine nature is there, not after cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, carnal, or, natural wiſe, but inuiſibly, vnſpeakea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3911:106"/> miraculouſely, ſupernaturally, ſpiritually, diuinely, and by waye to him onely knowen.</p>
               <p>And the fathers haue ben driuen to vſe theſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes for more ample and full declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the truth, and alſo for withſtanding and ſtopping obiections made by heretikes. And becauſe the catholike faith touching the veritie of Chriſtes body in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was not impugned by any man for the ſpace of a thouſand yeres after Chriſtes being in earth, and about that tyme Berengarius<note place="margin">Berenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</note> firſt beganne openly to ſowe the wicked ſede of the ſacramentarie hereſie, which then ſone confuted by learned men, and by the ſame firſt author abiured and recanted, now is with no leſſe wickednes, but more buſely and more earneſtly ſet forth againe: the doctoures that ſythe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s haue written in defence of the true and catholike faith herein, haue more often vſed the termes a fore mentioned, then the olde and auncient fathers, that wrote within M. Iuelles ſyx hundred yeres after Chriſt. who doubteles would no leſſe haue vſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if that matter had ben in queſtion or doubte in their tyme. And albeit theſe termes were ſtraunge and newe, as vſed within theſe fyue hundred yeres onely, and that the people were neuer taught for ſyx hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeres after Chriſt, as M. Iuell ſayeth, more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then truly, and therefore more raſhely then wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: yet the faith by them opened and declared, is vniuerſall and olde, verely no leſſe olde, then ys our lordes ſupper, where this Sacrament was firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted.</p>
               <p>Here before that I bring in places of auncient
<pb facs="tcp:3911:107" rendition="simple:additions"/> fathers reporting the ſame doctrine, and in like ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, as the catholike churche doth holde concerning this article: leaſt our opinion herein might happely appeare ouer carnall and groſſe: I thincke it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, briefly to declare, what maner a true bodie and bloud of Chriſt is in the ſacrament. Chriſt in him ſelfe hath but one fleſhe and bloud in ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which his godhed tooke of the virgine Mary once, and neuer afterward lefte it of.<note place="margin">The fleſhe and bloud of Chriſt is of dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deration.</note> But this one fleſhe and bloud in reſpecte of double qualitie, hath a double conſideration. For at what tyme Chriſt lyued here in earth among men in the ſhape of man, his fleſhe was thrall and ſubiecte to the frailtie of mannes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſynne and ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce excepted. That fleſhe being paſsible vntil death, the ſouldiers at the procurement of the Iewes crucified. And ſuch maner bloud was at his paſsion ſhedde foorth of his body, in ſighte of them which were then preſent. But after that Chriſt roſe againe from the deade, his body from that tyme forward euer remaineth immortall and liuely, in da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger no more of any infirmitie or ſuffering, much leſſe of death: but is become by diuine giftes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, a ſpirituall and a diuine body, as to whom the godhed hath communicated diuine and godly properties and excellencies, that ben aboue all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes capacitie of vnderſtanding. This fleſhe and body thus conſidered, which ſundry doctours call <hi>corpus ſpirituale &amp; deificatum,</hi> a ſpirituall and deified body, is geuen to vs in the bleſſed ſacrament.</p>
               <p>This is the doctrine of the church vttered by S. Hierome, in his commentaries vppon th'Epiſtle to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3911:107"/> the Epheſians, where he hath theſe wordes.<note place="margin">Lib. 1. ca. 1.</note>

The bloud and fleſhe of Chriſt is vnderſtanded two waies, either that it is that ſpiritual and diuine fleſhe, of which he ſpake him ſelfe, <hi>My fleſhe is verely meate, and my bloud is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely drinke,</hi> And, <hi>excepte ye eate my fleſhe and drinke my bloud ye ſhall not haue lyfe in you:</hi> Or, that fleſhe, which was crucified, and that bloud, which was ſhedde by pearcing of the ſouldiers ſpeare.

Cor. 15.</note> Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this diuiſion diuerſitie of bloud and fleſhe is to be vnderſtanded in ſainctes alſo, ſo as there is one fleſhe which ſhal ſee the ſaluacion of God, and an other fleſhe and bloud, which may not poſſeſſe the kingdom of God. Which two ſtates of fleſhe and bloud, ſeme (as it appeareth to the vnlearned) quite contrarie.</p>
               <p>But Saint Paul diſſolueth this doubte, in the fiftenth chapter of his firſt epiſtle to the Corinthians, ſaying,
<pb facs="tcp:3911:108" rendition="simple:additions"/> that fleſhe of ſuch ſorte as we beare about vs in this lyfe, earthly, mortal, fraile, and bourthenouſe to the ſoule, can not poſſeſſe the kingdom of God, becauſe corruption ſhal not poſſeſſe incorruption. But after reſurrection we ſhal haue a ſpirituall, gloriouſe, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible and immortall fleſh, and like in figure to the gloriouſe body of Chriſt, as S. Paul ſayeth: <hi>This cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible body muſt putte on incorruption, and this mortall, immortalitie,</hi> Then ſuch fleſhe, or our fleſhe of that maner and ſorte, ſhall poſſeſſe the kingdom of God, and ſhal beholde God him ſelfe. And yet our fleſhe now corruptible, and then incorruptible, is but one fleſhe in ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but diuerſe in qualitie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie. Euen ſo it is to be thought of our lordes fleſhe as is afore ſayde. The due weghing of this differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, geueth much light to this matter, and ought to ſtaye many horrible blaſphemies wickedly vttered againſt this moſt bleſſed Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Now whereas M. Iuell denyeth that Chriſten peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were of olde tyme taught to beleue, that Chriſtes body is really, ſubſtantially, corporally, carnally, or naturally in the Sacrament, I doo plainely affirme the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie. Yet I acknowledge, that the learned fathers which haue ſo taught, would not thereby ſeme to make it here outwardly ſenſible or perceptible.<note place="margin">Hom. 83. in Matt &amp; 60 ad po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pul.

               </p>
               <p>For they confeſſe all with Saint Chryſoſtome, that the thing which is here geuen vs, is not ſenſible, but that vnder viſible ſignes, inuiſible thinges be delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs. But they thought good to vſe the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed termes, to put awaye all doubte of the being of his very body in theſe holy myſteries, and to

Whereby the new Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters reaſons ſeme very peeuiſhe: Chriſt is aſcended, ergo he is not in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

Iuell and his felowes to call papiſtes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue verely, that it is our bownden duetie to adore the Sacrament, and to worſhip it with all godly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. By which word Sacrament notwithſtanding
<pb facs="tcp:3911:121" rendition="simple:additions"/> in this reſpect, we meane not the outward formes, that properly are called the ſacrament, but the thing of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the inuiſible grace and vertue therein conteined, euen the very body and bloud of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And when we adore and worſhip this bleſſed Sacrament, we doo not adore and worſhip the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it ſelfe of bread and wine, becauſe after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> none at all remaineth. Neither doo we adore the outward ſhapes and formes of bread and wine which remaine, for they be but creatures that ought not to be adored:<note place="margin">What Chriſten people adore in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> but the body it ſelfe and bloud of Chriſt, vnder thoſe formes verely and really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, lowly and deuoutly doo we adore. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſpeake more properly, and according to ſkill, leaſt our aduerſaries might take adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage againſt vs through occaſion of termes, where right ſenſe onely is meant: we proteſte and ſaye, that we doo and ought to adore and worſhip the body and bloud of Chriſt in the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>And here this much is further to be ſayde, that in the Sacrament of the aulter, the body of Chriſt is not adored by thought of mynde ſundred from the word, but being inſeparably vnited to the word. For this is ſpecially to be conſidered, that in this moſt holy Sacrament, the body and bloud of Chriſt are not preſent by them ſelues alone, as being ſeparated from his ſoule and from the godhed: but that there is here his true and lyuing fleſhe and bloud ioyned together with his godhed inſeparably, and that they be as him ſelfe is, perfite, whole and inſeparable Which is ſufficiently confirmed by ſundry his owne
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:3911:121"/> wordes in S. Iohn. <hi>I am</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>the bread of lyfe.</hi> Againe, <hi>this is bread comming downe from heauen, that if any eate of it, he dye not. I am the liuely bread that came downe from heauen, if any eate of this bread, he ſhall lyue euerlaſtingly.</hi> And to ſhewe what bread he meant, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth with theſe wordes: <hi>And the bread which I ſhall geue, is my fleſhe, which I ſhall geue for the life of the world.</hi> By which wordes he aſſureth vs plainely, that his fleſhe which he geueth vs to eate, is full of lyfe, and ioyned with his godhed, which bringeth to the worthy receiuers thereof, immortalitie as well of body as of ſoule. Which thing fleſhe and bloud of it ſelfe could not performe, as our lord him ſelfe declareth plainely, where he ſayeth, as there it folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth: <hi>It is the ſpirite that quikneth or geueth lyfe, the fleſhe profiteth nothing. The vvordes vvhich I haue spoken to you, bee spirite and life.</hi> As though he had ſayde thus. The fleſhe of it ſelfe profiteth nothing, but my fleſhe which is full of godhed and ſpirite, bringeth and worketh immortalitie and life euetlaſting to them that receiue it worthely. Thus we vnderſtand in this bleſſed Sacrament not onely the body and bloud of Chriſt, but all and whole Chriſt, God and man, to be preſent in ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and that for the inſeparable vnitie of the perſon of Chriſt: and for this cauſe we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our ſelues bownden to adore him, as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true God and man.</p>
               <p>For a clearer declaration hereof, I will not let to recite a notable ſentence out of S. Auguſtine, where he expoundeth theſe wordes of Chriſt:<note place="margin">In Ioan. tractat. 27</note> 
                  <hi>Then if ye ſee the ſonne of man go vp, vvhere he vvas before.</hi> There had
<pb facs="tcp:3911:122" rendition="simple:additions"/> ben no queſtion (ſayeth he) if he had thus ſayde: if ye ſee the ſonne of God go vp, where he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But whereas he ſayde, <hi>the ſonne of man go vp, vvhere he vvas before,</hi> what was the ſonne of man in heauen, before that he beganne to be in earth? Verely here he ſayde, where he was before, as though then he were not there, when he ſpake theſe wordes. And in an other place he ſayeth, <hi>No man hath aſcended in to heauen, but he that deſcended from heauen, the ſonne of man, vvhich is in heauen.</hi> He ſayde not was, but <hi>the ſonne of man</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>vvhich is in heauen.</hi> In earth he ſpake, and ſayde him ſelfe to be in heauen. To what pertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth this, but that we vnderſtand Chriſt to be one perſon, God and man, not two, leaſt our faith be not a trinitie, but a quaternitie? Wherefore Chriſt is one, the worde, the ſoule and the fleſhe, one Chriſt: the ſonne of God, and the ſonne of man, one Chriſt. The ſonne of God euer, the ſonne of man in tyme: yet one Chriſt according to th'unitie of perſon was in heauen, when he ſpake in earth. So was the ſonne of man in heauen, as the ſonne of god was in earth. The ſonne of god in earth in fleſhe taken, the ſonne of man in heauen in vnitie of perſon. This farre ſaint Auguſtine.</p>
               <p>Herevpon he expoundeth theſe wordes, <hi>it is the ſpirite that quikneth or geueth life, the fleſhe auaileth nothing,</hi> thus: The fleſhe profiteth nothing, but the onely fleſhe. Come the ſpirite to the fleſhe, and it profiteth very much. For if the fleſhe ſhuld profite nothing, the word ſhuld not be made fleſhe to dwell amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt vs. For this vnitie of perſon to be vnderſtanded
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:3911:122"/> in bothe natures (ſayeth the great learned father Leo) we reade that bothe the ſonne of man came downe from heauen,<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Flauianu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> epiſ. cap. 5.</note> when as the ſonne of god tooke fleſhe of that virgine, of whom he was borne: and againe, it is ſayde, that the ſonne of god was crucified and buryed, whereas he ſuffered theſe thinges, not in the godhed it ſelfe, in which the onely begote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is coeuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting and conſubſtantiall with the father, but in the infirmitie of humaine nature. Wherefore we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe all in the Crede alſo, the onely begoten ſonne of god crucified and buryed, according to that ſaying of th'apoſtle: <hi>For if they had knovven,</hi>

                  <hi>they vvould neuer haue crucifyed the lord of Maieſtie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According to this doctrine Cyrillus writing vpon S. Iohn, ſayeth,<note place="margin">In Ioan. li. 4. ca. 15.</note> he that eateth the fleſhe of Chriſt hath lyfe euerlaſting. For this fleſhe hath the word of god, which naturally is lyfe. Therfore he ſayeth: <hi>I vvill rayſe him againe in the laſt daye.</hi> For I, ſayde he, that is, my body, which ſhall be eaten, will raiſe him againe. For he is not other, then his fleſhe. I ſaye not this becauſe by nature he is not other, but becauſe after incarnation he ſuffereth not him ſelfe to be diuided in to two ſonnes. By which wordes he reproueth the hereſie of wicked Neſtorius, that went about to diuide Chriſt, and of Chriſt to make two ſonnes, the one the ſonne of god, the other the ſonne of Marye, and ſo two perſones. For which Neſtorius was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the firſt Epheſine councell, and alſo ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for that he ſayde, we receiue in this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t onely the fleſhe of Chriſt in the bread, and his bloud onely in the wine without the godhed, becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:3911:123" rendition="simple:additions"/> Chriſt ſayde, <hi>he that eateth my fleſhe,</hi> and ſayde not, he that eateth or drinketh my godhed, becauſe his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed can not be eaten, but his fleſhe onely. Which he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall cauille Cyrillus doth thus auoyd.<note place="margin">Vide Ana<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thematiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum. xi. Item ad Theodoſ. de recta fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de. &amp; li. 2. ad Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta fide.</note> Although (ſayeth he) the nature of the godhed be not eaten, yet we eate the body of Chriſt, which verely may be eaten. But this body is the Wordes owne proper body, which quikneth althinges. and in as much as it is the body of life, it is quikning or lyfe geuing.</p>
               <p>Now he quikneth vs or geueth vs lyfe, as God, the onely fonteine of lyfe. Wherefore ſuch ſpeaches vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the ſcriptures, of Chriſt, whereby that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to be attributed to the one nature, which apperteineth to the other, and contrary wiſe: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that incomprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible and vnſpeakeable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction and vnion of the diuine and humaine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in one perſon, are to be taken of him inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, in as much as he is both god and man: and not of this or that other nature onely, as being ſeuered from the other. For through cauſe of this inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnion, what ſo euer is apperteining or peculiar to either nature, it is rightly aſcribed, yea and it ought to be aſcribed to the whole perſon. And this is done, as the learned diuines terme it, <hi>per communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationem idiomatum.</hi> And thus Cyrillus teacheth, how chriſt maye be eaten, not according to the diuine, but humaine nature, which he tooke of vs, and ſo likewiſe he is of Chriſten people adored in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t according to his diuine nature.

Wherefore then ought not the lord there to be adored, where ye ſaye him to be preſent? Why ſhall we be forbydden to adore that, which is
<pb facs="tcp:3911:124" rendition="simple:additions"/> not onely ſacramentally, but alſo corporally the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt? Thomas toucheth the true body of Chriſt rayſed vp from the dead, and falling downe on his knees adoreth ſaying: <hi>My God and my lord.</hi> The diſciples adore the lord as well before as after his Aſcenſion. Matth. 28. Act. 1. And the lord in S. Iohn ſayeth to the blinde man,<note place="margin">Ioan. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>beleueſt thou in the ſonne of God?</hi> and he anſwered him ſaying, <hi>Lord who is he, that I may beleue in him? And Ieſus ſayed to him. Thou haſt bothe ſene him, and who ſpeaketh with thee, he it is. Then he ſayeth, lord I beleue. and he adored him.</hi> Now if we taught our lordes bread to be the natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, verely we would adore it alſo faithfully with the papiſtes. This much the Zuinglians againſt Luther. Whereby they prooue ſufficiently th'adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtes body in the Sacrament, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of Chriſt him ſelfe God and man, becauſe of the inſeparable coniunction of his diuine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine nature in vnitie of perſone, ſo as where his body is, there is it ioyned and vnited alſo vnto his godhed, and ſo there Chriſt is preſent perfitely, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſubſtantially, very god and man.</p>
               <p>For the cleare vnderſtanding whereof the better to be atteined, the ſcholaſtical Diuines haue profitably deuiſed the terme <hi>concomitantia,</hi> plainely and truly teaching that in this Sacrament after conſecration vnder the forme of breade is preſent the body of Chriſt, and vnder the forme of wine his bloud <hi>ex vi ſacramenti,</hi> and with the body vnder forme of bread alſo the bloud, the ſoule, and godhed of Chriſt, and likewiſe with the bloud, vnder the forme of wyne,

Whereby they meane, that where the body of Chriſt is preſent, by neceſſary ſequell, becauſe of the indiuiſible copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bothe natures in the vnitie of perſon, (for as much as the Word made fleſhe neuer lefte the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine nature) there is alſo his bloud, his ſoule, his godhed, and ſo whole and perfite Chriſt God and man. And in this reſpecte the terme is not to be miſliked of any godly learned man, though ſome newe Maiſters ſcoffe at it, who fill the meaſure of their predeceſſours, that likewiſe haue ben offended with termes for the apter declaration of certaine ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary articles of our faith, by holy and learned fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in generall councelles holeſomly deuiſed. Of which ſorte ben theſe, <hi>homouſion, humanatio, incarnatio, tranſubſtantiatio, etc.</hi> Now here is to be noted, how the Zuinglians, whom M. Iuell foloweth, in th'article of adoration confute the Lutherans, as on the other ſyde, the Lutherans in th'article of the preſence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the Zuinglians.

For when he deceiueth the ſenſes of the bodye, and remoueth not the mynde from true and right meaning, wherein ech man lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a faithfull lyfe there is no perill in religion. Or if whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he fayneth him ſelfe good, and doth or ſayeth thoſe thinges, that of congruence perteine to good angels, although he be thought to be good, this is not a perilouſe or ſickely errour of Chriſtian faith. But when as by theſe thinges he begynneth to bring vs to thinges quite contrarie, then to knowe him from the good Spirite, and not to go after him, it ſtandeth vs much vpon diligently to watche and take heede.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3911:129"/> Thus S. Auguſtine. This much for th'adoration of the Sacrament, or rather of Chriſt in the Sacrament, maye ſuffiſe.</p>

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3911:131"/> golden and ſyluerne dooues, made to repreſent the holy ghoſte, that were hanged vp ouer the holy fontes and aulters, ſaying that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to ſpeake of the holy ghoſte in the ſhape of a dooue.</p>
               <p>Neither hath the Sacrament ben kepte in all places and in all tymes in one maner of veſſels. So it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently kepte for the viage prouiſion for the ſicke, no catholike man will maineteine ſtrife for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and order of keping. Symmachus a very worthy biſhop of Rome in the tyme of Anaſtaſius the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, as it is written in his lyfe, made two veſſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of ſyluer to reſerue the Sacrament in, and ſet them on the aulters of two churches in Rome, of S. Sylueſter, and of S. Androw. Theſe veſſelles they call commonly, <hi>ciboria.</hi> We fynde likewiſe in the lyfe of S. Gregorie, that he alſo like Symmachus made ſuch a veſſell which they call <hi>ciborium</hi> for the Sacrament, with fouer pillours of pure ſyluer, and ſet it on the aulter at S. Petres in Rome.</p>
               <p>In a worke of <hi>Gregorius Turonenſis,</hi> this veſſell is called, <hi>turris in qua myſterium dominici corporis habeba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> a tower wherein our lordes body was kepte. In an olde booke <hi>de poenitentia</hi> of Theodorus the greke of <hi>Tarſus in Cilicia,</hi> ſometyme archbiſhop of Cantorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, before Beda his tyme, it is called <hi>pixis cum corpore Domini ad viaticum pro infirmis.</hi> The pyxe with our lordes body for the viage prouiſion for the ſicke. In that booke, in an admonition of a biſhop to his cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie in a ſynode, warning is geuen, that nothing be put vppon th'aulter in tyme of the Sacrifice, but the cofer of Relikes, the booke of the fouer Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſtes,
<pb facs="tcp:3911:132" rendition="simple:additions"/> and the pyxe with our lordes body.</p>
               <p>Thus we fynde that the bleſſed Sacrament hath alwaies ben kepte in ſome places in a pyxe hanged vp ouer the aulter, in ſome other places otherwiſe, euery where and in all tymes ſafely and reuerently, as is declared, to be alwaile in readynes for the viage prouiſion of the ſicke. Which keping of it for that godly purpoſe, and with like due reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, if M.

               <p>It is no ſmall argument of the antiquitie of this obſeruation, that S.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of theſe two. Secondly, it is taken ſo, as it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincte from that hydden and diuine thing of the Sacrament, that is to ſaye, for the outward formes onely, which are the holy ſigne of Chriſtes very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy preſent vnder them conteined.<note place="margin">Hovv the fathers are to be vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Thus the fathers call not onely the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but alſo the body and bloud of Chriſt it ſelfe in the ſacrament, ſometymes the truth, ſometymes a figure. the truth, that is to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:3911:142"/> witte, the very and true body and bloud of Chriſt a figure, in reſpecte of the maner of being of the ſame there preſent, which is really and ſubſtantially, but inuiſibly, vnder the viſible forme of the outward ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.

Which interpretation of Tertullian in dede is not according to the right ſenſe of Chriſtes wordes, though his meaning ſwarue not from the truth. For where as our lord ſayde, <hi>this is my body,</hi> he meant not ſo as though he had ſayde, the outward forme of the Sacrament, which here I delyuer to you, is a figure of my body vnder the ſame conteined, for as much as by theſe wordes, <hi>Hoc eſt,</hi> he ſhewed not the viſible forme of breade, but the ſubſtance of his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body, in to which by his diuine power he tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the bread.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wiſe, namely Theophylacte, and Damaſcen. He ſayd not (ſayeth Theophylact) This is a figure,<note place="margin">In Matth. cap. 26.

               <p>And the cauſe why Tertullian ſo expownded
<pb facs="tcp:3911:143" rendition="simple:additions"/> theſe wordes of Chriſt, was, that thereby he might take aduantage againſt Marcion the heretike, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tymes the fathers in heate of diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doo ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dle ſome places, not after the exacte ſignification of the wordes, but rather folowe ſuch waye, as ſerueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beſt to confut their aduerſarie.

Neither in that contention dyd Tertullian ſo much regard the exacte vſe of wordes, as how he might wynne his purpoſe, and driue his aduerſarie denying that Chriſt tooke the true body of man, and that he ſuffered death in dede, to confeſſe the truth, which he thought to bring to paſſe, by dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing an argument from the figure of his body, which conſiſteth in that which is viſible in the ſacrament, to proue the veritie of his body. and therefore in framing his reaſon by waie of illation he ſayeth, <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gura autem non eſſet, niſi veritatis eſſet corpus.</hi> There were not a figure, onleſſe there were a body of truth or a very body in dede.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:3911:143"/>
               <p>And whereas Tertullian vſeth this word figure in this place, it is not to be vnderſtanded to be ſuch,<note place="margin">The vvor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des figure, ſigne, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, etc. exclude not the truth.</note> as the figures of the olde teſtament bee, as though it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified the ſhewing of a thing to come, or of a thing abſent, which is wonte to be ſet againſt the truth, as contrary to the ſame: but it is ſuch a kinde of figure, as doth couer the truth preſent, and ſo as it were ioyned with the truth, as it is wonte to be taken in the newe teſtament, where it ſheweth rather the maner of a thing to be exhibited, then that it taketh awaie the truth of preſence of the thing which is exhibited. For elles concerning the truth of Chriſtes body in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, if any man doubte what opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he was of, he ſheweth him ſelfe plainely ſo to iudge of it, as euer hath ben taught in the catholike churche.

Nouum enim ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per exiſtit id, quod nuper eſt cognitu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> But now (ſayeth he) let vs be made partetakers of this paſſeouer, and yet but figuratiuely as yet, albe it this paſſeouer be more
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:3911:144"/> manifeſt, then that of the olde lawe. For the paſſeouer of the lawe (I ſpeake boldly) was a darke figure of a figure: but er it be long, we ſhall enioye it more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitely and more purely, when as the Word (that is the ſonne of God) ſhall drynke the ſame newe with vs in the kingdom of his father, opening and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the thinges, that now he ſheweth not in moſt clear wiſe. For that euer is newe, which of late is knowen. Where as this learned father calleth our paſſeouer that we eate a figure, whereof the lawe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeouer was a figure, terming it the figure of a figure, he aſketh leaue, as it were, ſo to ſaye, and confeſſeth him ſelfe to ſpeake boldely, alluding as it ſemeth to S. Paul, or at leaſt hauing faſt printed in his mynde his doctrine to the Hebrewes:<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> where he calleth the thinges of the lyfe to come, <hi>res ipſas,</hi> the very thinges the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, the thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges of the Newe teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, <hi>ipſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> imagine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> the very image of thinges: and the Olde teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, <hi>imaginis vmbra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> the ſhadowe of the image. Which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine Nazianzene applyeth to the Sacrament of the aulter. And his meaning is this, that although we be goten out of thoſe darknes of the lawe, yet we are not come to the full lyght, which we looke for in the world to come, where we ſhall ſee and beholde the very thinges them ſelues clearely, and we ſhall knowe as we are knowen. To be ſhorte, by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of the olde teſtament be but fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and ſhadowes of thinges to come, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of the Newe teſtament, not ſhadowes of thinges to come, but figures of thinges preſent, which are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined and delyuered vnder them in myſterie,
<pb facs="tcp:3911:145"/> but yet ſubſtantially at the ende all figures in heauen ſhall ceaſe and be aboliſhed, and there ſhall we ſee al thoſe thinges that here be hydden, clearely face to face. And where Chriſt ſayeth, that he will drinke his paſſeouer newe with vs in the kingdom of his father, Nazianzen ſo expowndeth that word <hi>(Newe)</hi> as it may be referred to the maner of the exhibiting, not to the thing exhibited. not that in the world to come we ſhall haue an other body of our lord, which now we haue not, but that we ſhall haue the ſelfe ſame body, that now we haue in the Sacrament of the aulter in a myſterie, but yet verely and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, after an other ſorte and maner, and in that reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecte newe. for ſo had without myſterie or couer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in cleare ſight and moſt ioyfull fruitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is newe in compariſon of this preſent knowledge.</p>
               <p>Thus the word figure reporteth not alwaies the abſence of the truth of a thing, as we ſee, but the maner of the thing either promyſed, or exhibited. that for as much as it is not clearly and fully ſene, it be called a figure. ſo of Origen it is called <hi>imago re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Pſal. 38 homil. 2.</note> an image of the thinges, as in this place. <hi>Si quis verò tranſire potuerit ab hac vmbra, veniat ad imaginem rerum, &amp; videat aduentum Chriſti in carne factum, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deat cum pontificem offerentem quidem &amp; nunc patri ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtias, &amp; poſt modum oblaturum, &amp; intelligat haec omnia imagines eſſe ſpiritualium rerum, &amp; corporalibus officijs coeleſtia deſignari. Imago ergo dicitur hoc quod recipitur ad praeſens, &amp; intueri poteſt humana natura.</hi> And if any man (ſayeth he) can paſſe and departe from this ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, let him come to the image of thinges, and ſee
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:3911:145"/> the comming of Chriſt made in fleſhe, let him ſee him a biſhop that bothe now offereth ſacrifice vnto his father, and alſo hereafter ſhall offer. And let him vnderſtand, that all theſe thinges be images of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall thinges, and that by bodily ſeruices heauenly thinges be reſembled and ſet forth. So this which is at this preſent receiued, and may of mannes nature be ſene, is called an image. In this ſaying of Origen this word image doth not in ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diminiſhe the truth of thinges, ſo as they be not the very thinges in dede, for the thinges that Chriſt dyd in fleſhe, were true thinges: but when they are termed the image of thinges, thereby is ſignified, ſo farre, as the condition and nature of man can beholde and ſee them.</p>
               <p>This is moſt plainely vttered by <hi>Oecumenius</hi> a Greke writer, vppon theſe wordes of ſaint Paul to the Hebrewes. <hi>Non ipſam imaginem rerum.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 10.</note> Not the image it ſelfe of thinges, <hi>id eſt, veritàtem rerum,</hi> that is the truth of thinges, ſayeth he. and addeth further. <hi>Res appellat futuram vitam, imaginem aute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rerum, Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicam politiam, vmbram verò imaginis rerum, vetus Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamentum, imago enim manifeſtiora oſtendit exemplaria: adumbratio autem imaginis obſcurius haec manifeſtat, nam haec veteris teſtamenti exprimit imbecillitatem.</hi> The ſenſe of which wordes may thus be vttered in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh. S. Paul calleth the lyfe to come, the thinges, and the ordinance or diſpoſition of the thinges in the goſpell, he calleth the image of thinges, and the olde teſtament, he nameth the ſhadowe of the image of thinges. For an image ſheweth ſamples more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt:
<pb facs="tcp:3911:146"/> but the adumbration or ſhadowing of the image ſheweth theſe thinges but darkely, for this doth expreſſe the weakenes of the olde teſtament. By this place of <hi>Oecumenius</hi> we ſee, that although it be proper to an image to exhibite the truth of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and therefore by interpretation he ſayeth, <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, id eſt, veritatem,</hi> the image, that is, the truth yet the proper and right taking of the word, ſignifieth the waye or maner of a thing to be exhibited, not the thing it ſelfe: that what the image hath leſſe then the thing it ſelfe, it is to be vnderſtanded in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of exhibiting, not in the thing it ſelfe exhibited.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we haue brought examples to declare that the wordes, figure and image, ſignifie the truth of thinges exhibited in dede, though in ſecrete and priuie maner. Certaine fathers vſe the wordes <hi>ſignum &amp; ſacramentum,</hi> that is, ſigne and Sacrament, in the ſame ſignification.

               <p>In theſe wordes of Saint Auguſtine we ſee the fleſhe of Chriſt called a ſacrament of his fleſhe, and the bloud a Sacrament of his bloud, in as much as they be coouered with the forme of bread and wyne, yet verely and in ſubſtance preſent, and likewiſe he letteth not to call this veritie or truth of the thinges them ſelues thus couertly exhibited, a ſigne of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes viſible and palpable body: ſo that the naming of a ſigne doth not importe a ſeparation from the truth, but ſheweth a diſtincte maner of the truth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited: And therefore according to the truth of the maner of exhibiting, it is not the fleſhe of Chriſt, but the ſacrament of the fleſhe of Chriſt, for that the fleſhe doth not exhibite it ſelfe in his owne ſhape, but in a Sacrament.

               <p>By this father, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the great General Councell of Chalcedon agniſed for ſupreme gouernour of the churche of Chriſt, and honoured with the ſingular title of the Vniuerſall Biſhop, it is ordeined, that if any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where one churche could not conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly holde all the people together at one time they that came after the firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie, ſhuld haue their deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſerued by hauing an other Maſſe celebrated againe. And leaſt perhappes ſome might doubte wether that were lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſo to be done or no, or be cauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome doubted
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:3911:149"/> thereof, as now likewiſe ſome ſeme to doubte of it to put the matter out of doubte, he ſayeth aſſuredly, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificij oblatio indubitanter iteretur.</hi> Let them not ſticke to iterate or doo againe the oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Sacrifice, that is to ſaie, let the Maſſe be celebrated againe, <hi>indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter,</hi> without caſting perill, without ſticking, ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garing, or doubting. In that epiſtle he ſheweth two great cauſes, why mo Maſſes then one, maye be done in one churche in one daie. The one is, leaſt the afterco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mers ſhuld ſeme reiected, <hi>no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> recepti,</hi> not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, the other is, that the one parte of the people be not defrauded of the benefite of their deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As him ſelfe ſayeth, <hi>Neceſſe eſt aute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vt quaeda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pars populi ſua de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e priuetur ſi vnius tantu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Miſſae more ſeruato, ſacrificiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> offerre non poſsint, niſi qui prima diei parte conuenerint.</hi> It muſt nedes be that a parte of the people be berefte of their deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if the cuſto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hauing one Maſſe onely kepte, none maye offer the ſacrifice, but ſuch as came to church together in the morning, or firſt parte of the daye. Now the people may neither be reiected, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath choſen, nor ſparkled abroade, whom our lord hath gathered together, neither ought they to be defrauded of their deuotion, by withdrawing the Maſſe from them, but rather to be ſtyrred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto by their deuout preſence at the celebration of the ſame, where the death and paſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our lord is liuely repreſented before their eyes, the very ſame body that ſuffered on the croſſe, of them by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie of the prieſt offered to the father, in a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but truly, not to be a newe Rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption, but in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of the redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> allready performed.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3911:150"/>
               <p>By this teſtimonie we fynde, that it was laufull within ſyx hundred yeres after Chriſt, (for Leo ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued about the yere of our lord 450.) to haue two Maſſes in one churche in one daie, for ſo much the word <hi>iteretur</hi> doth importe at leaſt, and if there where mo, the caſe ſo requyring, the word will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are it well ynough.</p>
               <p>Now by this holy biſhoppes godly will, the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of hauing one Maſſe onely in one daie was abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, and this decreed, that in tyme of two ſundry reſortes of people to church, two ſundry Maſſes ſhuld be celebrated, for the auoiding of theſe two inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, leaſt the aftercommers ſhuld ſeme not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, but reiected like exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate perſones, and that a parte of the faithfull people ſhuld not be put beſyde their deuotion. Whereuppon I make this reaſon. The cauſes ſtanding, the effectes folowe: But the danger of the peoples ſeeming to be reiected, and the defrauding of their deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which are cauſes of iterating the Maſſe in one daie, did in that age in ſome holy daies of likelyhod thriſe, yea iiij. or v. tymes happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and in our tyme moſt certainely doth commonly ſo often, or oftener happen: wherefore the Maſſe may ſo many tymes be ſayd in a daye in one churche.</p>
               <p>Where great multitude of Chriſten people is, as in townes, we ſee ſome reſorte to churche early in the morning, making their ſpirituall oblations to th'intent to ſerue God, or they ſerue man in their worldly affaires. All can not come ſo early. others come at their conuenient oportunitie, ſome at ſyx,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:3911:150"/> ſome at ſeuen, ſome at eight, ſome at nyne or ten of the clocke. If they which through laufull lettes can not come at the firſt houres, comming afterward be rowndly tolde by the prieſt, come ye at ſuch or ſuch houres, or elles ye gete no Maſſe here ſhall not they according to Leo his ſaying ſeme to be reiected, and defrauded of their deuotion? All well diſpoſed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple about Powles can not come to poſtelles Maſſe at fouer or fyue of the clocke in the morning, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at high Maſſe there. Shall all ſuch in a Terme or Parlament tyme, when great reſorte is, be denyed that ſpirituall conforte? And if they bee, ſhall not they ſeme reiected and put from their deuotion?</p>
               <p>Which inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience that it might not happen, Leo willeth not onely twoo, but three, fouer, or mo Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to be done on a daye, for his wordes reporte no leſſe. <hi>Cum plenum pietatis atque rationis ſit, vt quoties baſilicam, in qua agitur, praeſentia nouae plebis impleuerit, toties ſacrificium ſubſequens offeratur.</hi> Let there be no ſticking at the iterating of the Maſſe. For as much as (ſayeth he) it is a thing full of godlyneſſe and reaſon, that how often the churche where the ſeruice is done, is filled with a newe companie of people, ſo often the Sacrifice there efteſones be offered. Here he willeth plainely that Maſſe be done, <hi>toties quoties,</hi> at euery newe reſorte of the well diſpoſed people, and that for theſe weighty cauſes, leaſt parte of the people ſhuld ſeme not receiued, and that they be not defrauded of their deuotion. Wherefore, they that reproue the pluralitie of Maſſes in one churche in one daie, after the iudgement of this worthy father,
<pb facs="tcp:3911:151"/> be reiectours of the faithfull people and robbers of their deuotion. But they that haue vtterly abrogated the Maſſe, which is the outward and the euer endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Sacrifice of the newe teſtament, by verdite of Scripture, be no leſſe then the foreru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</p>

For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyde that the prohibition preſuppoſeth the thing prohibited to haue ben before vſed, (elles prohibitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had ben ſuperfluouſe, and ſo farre forth it appeareth that before the making of that decree mo Maſſes were ſayde at one aulter in one daye) the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of this decree ſerueth very well for proufe, that by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of this councell, it was then lawfull to ſaye mo Maſſes in one churche in one daye. For this prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the councell is not generall but ſpeciall, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted to a particular place of the churche, <hi>in vno altario,</hi> at one aulter, which includeth not of any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon a more generall and larger matter then it ſelfe, as, neither at any other aulter in the ſame church the ſame daye it ſhal be lawfull to ſaye Maſſe: But of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <hi>Be not they
<pb facs="tcp:3911:153"/> which eate ſacrifices partakers of the aulter?</hi> It is certaine, that they, who dooing ſacrifice doo not eate, be gylty of our lordes ſacrament. Wherefore what prieſt ſo euer hereafter ſhal come vnto the holy aulter to offer ſacrifice, and ſuſpend him ſelfe from the communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be it knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him, that he is repelled and thruſt awaye from the grace of the communion, whereof he hath vnſemely bereued him ſelfe, (whereby is meant that he ſtandeth exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate) for the ſpace of one yere.

               <p>This much graunted, as by any reaſonable vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it can not be drawen, nor by racking can be ſtretched to any other ſenſe: we haue here good auctoritie for the hauing of many Maſſes in one churche in one daye. And where as the fathers of that councell allowed many Maſſes in one daye ſayde by one prieſt, there is no reaſon, why they ſhuld not allowe the ſame ſayd by ſundry prieſtes in one daye. If our aduerſaries ſaye, this might haue ben done in ſundry places, whereby they may ſeme to fruſtrate our purpoſe touching this article: we anſwere, that beſyde th'approuing of the Maſſe by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed, it were vaine and fryuolouſe to imagine ſuch gadding of the prieſtes from churche to churche for ſaying many Maſſes in one daye. Doubteleſſe the fathers of that Toletane Councell meant of many Maſſes ſayd in one place in a daye, as Leo dyd, for ſeruing the faithfull peoples deuotion, that reſorted to churche at ſundry houres, as we ſee the people doo now, that ſo all might be ſatisfied. Which ſhuld not haue ben, if one Maſſe onely had ben ſayde.</p>
               <p>If M.

Firſt, the bleſſed ſacrifice of the Maſſe, which the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> fathers of this councell call the true and ſingular ſacrifice, the ſacrifice of the body and bloud of our lord IESVS CHRIST, the ſacrifice of the
<pb facs="tcp:3911:154"/> body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt our lorde, which the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> prieſt offereth on the aulter. Nexte, the truth and reall preſence of the body and bloud of our lorde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in the ſacrifice offered. Then aulters, which this councell calleth diuine or holy, for the diuine and holy thinges on them offered, the body and bloud of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Chriſt. Furthermore, the multitude of Maſſes in one daye. for they ſpeake of many ſacrifices, that is, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Maſſes, <hi>plurima ſacrificia.</hi> Laſtly, priuate Maſſes. For the wordes <hi>nec ipſe ſacrificans,</hi> rightly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrewed and weighed, importe no leſſe. For where as no worde in this decree is vttered, whereby it maye appeare the people to be of neceſsitie requyred to receiue, if the prieſtes had receiued them ſelues at euery Maſſe, no faulte had ben fownde.

Athanaſius writeth that Nicodeme, who came to Ieſus by night, made an image of Chriſt with his owne handes, and that when he laye in his death bedde, he delyuered it to Gamaliel, who was S. Paules ſcoolemaiſter. Gamaliel when he ſawe he ſhuld dye, lefte it to Iames, Iames lefte it to Simon and Zachaeus. This image came from hand, to hand by ſucceſsion, and continewed a long tyme in Hieruſalem. From Hieruſalem it was caried into Syria, and at length it was brought to the citie Berytus, not farre from Tyre and Sydon. Where how deſpitefully it was vſed of the Iewes, and what wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders enſued thereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who liſt to knowe, may he reade it largely declared in a litle booke written by Athanaſius of that matter. <hi>Euſebius Caeſarienſis</hi> in the ſeuenth booke of his ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall ſtorie,<note place="margin">Cap. 14.</note> writeth of the auncient image of

Which image he ſayeth he ſawe, as likewiſe the images of Peter and Paul kepte by ſome of olde tyme. And there he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeth, that the images of Peter and Paul and of our Sauiour were in his tyme made, and painted in tables and ſet forth. After Euſebius death Iulian the renegate tooke downe this image of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Lib. 6. tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. cap. 41.</note> and ſet vp his owne in the ſame place. Which with violent fyer that fell from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was clefte aſunder in the breſt, the hedde broken of with a peece of the necke, and ſtickt in the grownde. The reſt of it ſo remayned long after, as a token of lightning and gods diſpleaſur might be reſerued.

               <p>It is euident by Chryſoſtomes Maſſe, that there was ſome vſe of images in the church of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople in his tyme, for he ſpeaketh of the image of the crucifixe.

               <p>Simeon Metaphraſtes a greke writer, deſcribing rhe lyfe of S. Luke th'euangeliſt, ſayeth that he made the images of Chriſt and of his mother Mary.

               <p>Gregorie Nyſſene S.

In which images he acknowlegeth the fightes of the martyr to be declared no leſſe, then if they were deſcribed and written in a booke.</p>
               <p>Paulinus the biſhop of Nola, in his booke that he

Baſile, whoſe auctoritie for learning, wiſedom, and holynes of lyfe, beſyde antiquitie, is ſo weighty in the iudgement of all men, that all our newe maiſters layed in balance againſt him, ſhall be fownde lighter then any fether.<note place="margin">Citatur ab Adriano Papa in epiſtola Synodica ad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; Irenen.</note> Touching this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, making a confeſsion of his faith in an epiſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueghing againſt Iulian the renegate, he ſayeth thus. Euen as we haue receyued our Chriſtian and pure faith of God, as it were by right of heretage: right ſo I make my confeſsion thereof to hym, and therein I abyde. I beleeue in one God father almighty, God
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:3911:159"/> the father, God the ſonne, God the holy ghoſte. One God (in ſubſtance) and theſe three (in perſones) I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ore and glorifie.

Then afterward ſainct Mary, who according to the fleſhe brought hym foorth, callyng her <hi>Deiparam.</hi> I reuerence alſo the holy Apoſtles, Prophetes, and Martyrs, which make ſupplication to god for me: that by their mediation our moſt benigne god be mercifull vnto me, and graunt me freely remiſsion of my ſynnes. Then this foloweth. <hi>Quam ob cauſam &amp; hiſtorias imaginu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> illorum honoro. &amp; palàm adoro: hoc enim nobis traditum à ſanctis Apoſtolis, non eſt prohiben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, ſed in omnibus eccleſijs noſtris eorum hiſtorias eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimus.</hi> For the which cauſe I doo both honour the ſtories of their images, and openly adore them. For this being delyuered vnto vs of the holy Apoſtles by tradition, is not to be forbidden. And therefore we ſet vp in all our churches their ſtories. Lo M. Iuell here you ſee a ſufficient teſtimonie, that Images were ſet vp in the churches long before the ende of your ſyx hundred yeres, and that they were honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and worſhipped not onely of the ſimple chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people, but of biſhop Baſile, who for his excellent learning and wiſedom, was renoumed with the name of Great.</p>
               <p>Now that there hath ben ynough alleaged for the Antiquitie, orginall and approbation of Images,<note place="margin">Three cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes vvhy images hauen ben vſed in the church.</note> it remayeth, it be declared, for what cauſes they haue ben vſed in the church. We fynde that the vſe of images hath ben brought into the church for three cauſes. The firſt, is the benefite of knowledge. For
<pb facs="tcp:3911:160"/> the ſimple and vnlearned people, which be vtterly ignorant of letters, in pictures doo as it were, reade and ſee noleſſe then others doo in bookes, the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of chriſten Religion, the actes and worthy dedes of Chriſt and of his ſainctes. What writing performeth to them that reade, the ſame doth a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture to the ſimple beholding it,<note place="margin">Ad Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> epiſco<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Maſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lien. li. 9. epiſtol. 9.</note> ſayeth S. Gregory. For in the ſame the ignorant ſee, what they ought to folowe, in the ſame they reade, which can no let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, therefor Imagerie ſerueth ſpecially the rude na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in ſtede of writing, ſayeth he.</p>
               <p>To this S. Baſile agreeth in his homilie vpon the forty martyrs. Bothe the writers of ſtories (ſayeth he) and alſo paineters do ſhewe and ſet forth noble dedes of armes and victories, the one garniſhing the matter with eloquence, the other drawing it lyuely in tables, and bothe haue ſtyrred many to valiant courage. For what thynges the vttera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the ſtorie expreſſeth through hearing, the ſame doth the ſtille picture ſet forth through imitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In the like reſpecte in olde tyme the worke of excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t poetes was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a ſpeaking picture,<note place="margin">Pictura lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma tace<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> and the worke of payneters, a ſtille poetrie. And thus the vſe and profite of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and of pictures, is one. For thinges that be read, when as they come to our eares, then we conueigh them ouer to the mynde, and the thinges that we beholde in pictures with our eyes, the ſame alſo doo we imbrace in our mynde. And ſo by theſe two, reading and painting, we acheue one like benefite of knowledge.</p>
               <p>The ſecond cauſe of the vſe of Images, is the ſtyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:3911:160"/> of our myndes to all godlynes. For whereas the affecte and deſyre of man is heauy and dull in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and ſpirituall thinges,<note place="margin">Sapient. 9</note> becauſe the body that is corruptible weigheth downe the mynde when it is ſet forth before our eyes by images, what Chriſt hath done for vs, and what the Sainctes haue done for Chriſt: then it is quickened and moued to the like will of doing and ſuffering, and to all endeuour of holy and vertuouſe life. As when we heare apte and fitte wordes vttered in a ſermon or an oration: ſo when we beholde lookes and geſtures liuely expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in images, we are moued to pitie, to weeping, to ioye, and to other affectes. Wherein verely it hath alwayes ben thought, that paineters haue had no leſſe grace, then either oratours or poetes.</p>
               <p>Who liſteth to ſee examples hereof, he may peruſe the ſecond Nicene councell,<note place="margin">Action. 4.</note> where he ſhall fynde among other moſt notable thinges concerning this point, one of ſainct Euphemia the martyr, an other of Abraham ſacrificing his ſonne Iſaac worthy of euerlaſting memorie; that of Aſterius the holy biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, this of Gregory Nyſſene, very elegantly deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed. Virgil maketh Aeneas to weepe, to hope for better fortune, to gather courage of mynde, to take good aduiſe and order for redreſſe and helpe of his great calamities, by occaſion of beholding a painters worke at Carthago, wherein the bataile of Troye was expreſſed. Which that wiſe poete would not haue done, were not that pictures haue great force to moue mennes hartes.</p>
               <p>Ouide likewiſe in the epiſtle of <hi>Laodamia</hi> to <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſilaus</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3911:161"/> her husband being forth at warres, maketh her ſo to write of his image, which ſhe had cauſed to be made of waxe for her conforte in his abſence, as it may well appeare, that images haue a meruelouſe power to ſtirre vehement affectes, and to repreſent thinges abſent, as though in maner they were preſent, in the myndes of the beholders.</p>
               <p>Among all other examples for this purpoſe, that ſemeth to me moſt notable, which <hi>Appianus</hi> writeth of <hi>C. Iulius Caeſar. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de bellis ciuilib.</hi> After that Caeſar had ben murdered of the Senatours in the counſaile houſe, one of his fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des to ſhewe the crueltie of the facte to the people, layed Caeſars bedde in the open market place, and tooke forth of it his image made of waxe, which repreſented three and twenty woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des after a beaſtly ſorte ſtabde in to his face and all the reſte of his body, yet gaping and as it were freſhe bleeding. Whith which ſhewe he ſtyrred the people to more wrath and rage, then he could haue done with any oration or geſture. Which was declared forth with. For as ſone as the people ſawe it, not able to beare their griefe nor ſtaye their furie any lenger, wrought great and ſtraunge cruelties againſt them, that were fownde to haue committed that murder.</p>
               <p>The third cauſe why images haue ben ſet vp in Churches, is the keping of thinges in memorie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to our ſaluation. For when we caſt our eyes on them, our memorie which otherwiſe is fraile and weake, gathereth together and embraceth the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites and merites of our Sauiour Chriſt, and the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſe
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:3911:161"/> examples of ſainctes, which we ought to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe: that if we bee ſuch as they were, we may by gods grace through Chriſt atteine the blyſſe they be in, and with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enioye lyfe euerlaſting. And verely they that haue images in regard and reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, muſt be ſo mynded, as they beholde not onely the thinges by them repreſented, but alſo performe the ſame in dede with moſt diligent imitation.</p>
               <p>And now we are come to declare, how Images maye he worſhipped and honoured without any offence.<note place="margin">Hovv ima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges may be vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped vvithout offence.</note> That godly worſhip which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite and truth inwardly, and is declared by ſignes outwardy in recongnizing the ſupreme dominion, which properly of the diuines is called <hi>Latria:</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred onely to the bleſſed Trinitie. As for the holy images, to them we doo not attribute that worſhip at all, but an inferiour reuerence or adoration, for ſo it is named. Which is nothing elles, but a recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of ſome vertue or excellencie proteſted by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſigne, as reuerent kiſsing, bowing downe, knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and ſuch the like honour. Which kynde of ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or worſhip, we fynde in the ſcriptures often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes geuen to creatures. The whole acte whereof is notwithſtanding referred not to the images prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, but to the thinges by them repreſented, as being the true and proper obiectes of ſuch worſhip. For although the honour of an image paſſeth ouer to the originall or firſt ſampler, which the learned call <hi>archetypum,</hi> as S. Baſile teacheth:<note place="margin">Li. ad Am<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>philoch. cap. 18.</note> yet that high worſhip called <hi>Latria,</hi> belongeth onely to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trinitie, and not to the reuerent images, leaſt we
<pb facs="tcp:3911:162"/> ſhuld ſeme to be worſhippers of creatures and of matters, as of golde, ſyluer, ſtones, woodde, and of ſuch other the like thinges. For we adore not images as God,<note place="margin">In queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onib. ad Antiochu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Principe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> ſayeth Athanaſius, neither in them doo we put hope of our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ne to them doo we geue godly ſeruice or worſhip, for ſo dyd the gentiles: but by ſuch adoration or reuerence, we declare onely a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine affection and loue, which we beare toward the originalles. And therfore if it happen their figure and ſhape to be defaced and vndone, we let not to burne the ſtockes, as very woodde, and being of other ſtuffe, to conuert the ſame to any vſe, it maye ſerue beſt for.</p>
               <p>S. Gregory prayſing much one <hi>Secundinus,</hi> for that he deſyred the Image of our Sauiour to be ſent vnto him, to th'entent by hauing his image before his eyes, he might the more be ſtirred to loue him in his hart after a fewe wordes vttered in this ſenſe, he ſayeth further. We knowe thou demaundeſt not the image of our Sauiour to th'entent to worſhip it, as God: but for the remembrance of the ſonne of God, that thou mighteſt be enkendled with the loue of him, whoſe image thou deſyreſt to beholde. And verely we fall not downe before it, as before God. But we adore and worſhip him, whom through oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the image, we remember either borne, or done to death for vs, or ſitting in his throne. And whiles we reduce the ſonne of God to our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie by the picture no leſſe then by writing, it bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth either gladnes to our mynde by reaſon of his Reſurrection, or confort by reaſon of his Paſsion.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:3911:162"/> And if men praye kneelyng before any image or triumphant ſigne of the holy Croſſe, they worſhip not the woodde or ſtone figured, but they honour the higheſt God. And whom they can not beholde with ſenſes, they reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and worſhip his image re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting him according to auncient Inſtitution, not reſting or ſtaying them ſelues in the image, but tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the adoration and worſhip to him that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented. Thus farre S. Gregorie.</p>
               <p>Much might be alleaged out of the fathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the worſhipping of Images, but this may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſe. And of all this one ſenſe redowndeth, that what reuerence, honour, or worſhip ſo euer is applyed to Images, it is but for reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, loue and honour of the primitiues or originalles. As when we kyſſe the goſpell booke, by that token we honour not the parchement, paper and incke, wherein it is written, but the goſpell it ſelfe. And as Iacob,<note place="margin">Gen. 37.</note> when he kyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his ſonne Ioſephes cote embrewed with kyddes bloud, holding and embracing it in his armes, and making heauy mone ouer it, the affection of his loue and ſorowe reſted not in the cote, but was directed to Ioſeph him ſelfe, whoſe infortunat death (as he thought) that blouddy cote repreſented: So Chriſten men ſhewing tokens of reuerence, loue and honour before the Image of Chriſt, of an Apoſtle, or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, with their inward recognition and deuotion of their hartes, they ſtaye not their thoughtes in the very Images, but deferre the whole to Chriſt, to the Apoſtle, and to the Martyr, geuing to ech one in dewe proportion, that which is to be geuen, putting
<pb facs="tcp:3911:163"/> difference betwen the almighty Creator and the creatures, finally rendring all honour and glory to God alone, who is maruelous in his ſainctes. Such worſhipping of Images is neither to be accompted for wicked, nor to be diſpyſed, for the which we haue the teſtimonies of the auncient fathers, bothe Grekes and Latines: vnto which further auctoritie is added by certaine generall Councelles, that haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the brekers and impugners of the ſame.</p>

Which euill cometh not of the ſcripture, but of their owne malice and euill diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>The dangers and hurtes which the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> reading of the ſcriptures in their owne la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage bryngeth, after the opinion of thoſe that reproue the ſame, be great, ſundry and many. I will here, as it were but touche a fewe of them, leauing the whole matter it ſelfe to the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the churche. Firſt, ſeing the poyſon of heretikes doth moſt infecte the common people, and all heretikes drawe their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyme out of the Bible vnder pretence of gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de: it is not thought good by theſe men, to lette eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry curiouſe and buſie body of the vulgar ſorte, to reade and examine the Bible in their common lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. Yet they would not the learned, diſcrete and ſober laye men to be imbarred of that libertie.</p>
               <p>Againe if hereſie ſpring of wrong vnderſtanding,<note place="margin">De trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate li. 2.</note> not of the ſcriptures, (as Hilarius ſayeth, hereſie is of vnderſtanding, not of ſcripture, and the ſenſe not the worde is a crime) who ſhall ſooner fall into hereſie, then the common people, who can not vnderſtande that they reade? verely it ſemeth a thing hard to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, that the vnlearned people ſhuld vnderſtande that, which the beſt learned men with long ſtudie and great trauaill can ſcarcely at length atteine.</p>
               <p>Whereas Luther would the ſcriptures to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into euery vulgare tonge, for that they be
<pb facs="tcp:3911:166"/> lyght and eaſie to vnderſtande, he is confuted by the ſcripture it ſelfe. For both S. Peter, and alſo S. Paul, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlegeth in them to be great difficulties, by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion whereof ſome miſconſtrue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their owne damnation,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 1. Tim 1. 2. Cor. 4.</note> ſome vnderſtande not what thinges they ſpeake, nor of what thinges they affirme, and to ſome the goſpell that S. Paul preached is hydden, euen to them which periſhe. If the ſcriptures were playne, how erred Arius? how Macedonius? how Eunomius? how Neſtorius? how many mo, men of great learning? ſpecially ſeing they all tooke occaſion of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the ſcripture not rightly vnderſtanded?</p>
               <p>Luther ſayeth that S. Hierome was ouerſeen in the vnderſtanding of the ſcripture, that S. Auguſtine erred in the ſame, that S. Ambroſe, Cyprian, Hilary, Baſile, and Chryſoſtome, the beſt learned doctours of Chriſtes churche, were oftentymes deceiued. And yet in the preface of his booke <hi>de captiuitate Babilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica,</hi> he ſpeaketh of them very honorably, and graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that they haue laboured in the lordes vineyarde worthely, and that they haue employed great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in opening the ſcriptures. If theſe being of ſo excellent learning after long exerciſe in the holy letters, after long ſtudie and watche, after long and feruent prayer, after mortification of them ſelues, and purgation of carnall affections were deceiued, as he witneſſeth: how can he ſaye they are cleare, plaine and eaſye to be vnderſtanded? And if theſe worthy fathers were deceiued in one pointe or two, is it not likely the common people may be deceiued in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſpecially their dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and ſtudy not being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:3911:166"/> to theirs, and their lyues not being ſuch, as the cleanneſſe of their inward affectes might lighten their vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, and the annointing of god might teach them.</p>
               <p>And leaſt all the vnlearned laye people ſhulde ſeme hereby vtterly reiected from hope of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding gods worde without teaching of others, it may be graunted, that it is not impoſsible, a man (be he neuer ſo vnlearned) exerciſed in long prayer, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to feruent contemplation, being brought by God into his inward cellares, may from thence obteine the true vnderſtanding and interpretation of the holy ſcriptures, no leſſe then any other alwaies brought vp in learning. Of what ſorte S. Antony that holy and perfecte man the Eremite of Egypte, was. Who, as ſaint Auguſtine writeth,<note place="margin">Prologo in libros de doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiana.</note> without any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of letters, both canned the ſcriptures by hart with hearing, and vnderſtode them wiſely with thynking.

Now he proueth further by teſtimonie of their owne wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges, that the Anabaptiſtes be diuided into ſyx ſectes, the Sacramentaries into eight ſectes, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsioniſtes and they which properly are called pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes,<note place="margin">Proteſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into tvventy Sectes.</note> into twenty ſectes, euery one hauing his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and particular name to be called and knowen by. This lamentable diuiſion of learned men into ſo many ſectes in the countries where the goſpell (as they call it) hath theſe forty yeres and is yet moſt buſely handled, may be a warning to the gouernours of Chriſtendome, that they take good aduiſement, how they ſuffer the rude and raſhe people, to haue the ſcriptures common in their owne tonge.</p>
               <p>The perill of it is knowen by ſundry examples bothe of tymes paſt, and alſo of this preſent age. For out of this roote hath ſprong the ſecte of the <hi>Valden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Valdenſes</note> otherwiſe called <hi>Pauperes de Lugduno.</hi> For Valdo a merchant of Lyons their firſt author, of whom they were named <hi>Valdenſes,</hi> being an vnlearned laye man, procured certaine bookes of the ſcripture to be tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into his owne language, which when he vſed to reade and vnderſtoode not, he fell into many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. Of the ſame wellſpring yſſued the fylthie pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels of the ſectes called <hi>Adamitae</hi> or <hi>Picardi, Begardi,</hi> and <hi>Turelupini,</hi> and of late yeres beſyde the ſame ſecte of Adamites newly reuiued, alſo the Anabaptiſtes,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:3911:168"/> and Suenkfeldians. Wherfor that edicte or proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worthy Princes <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> kyng and Quene of Spayne, is of many much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, by which they gaue ſtreight commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that vnder great penalties, no man ſhuld tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Bible into the vulgare Spaniſh to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, and that no man ſhuld be fownde, to haue the ſame tranſlated in any wiſe. Theſe and the like be the reaſons and conſyderations, which haue moued many men to thinke, the ſetting forth of the whole Bible, and of euery parte of the ſcripture in the vulgare tonge, for all ſortes of perſons to reade without exception or limitation, to be a thing not neceſſary to ſaluation, nor otherwiſe conuenient, nor profitable, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe dangerous and hurtefull.</p>
               <p>Yet it is not meant by them, that the people be kepte wholly from the ſcripture, ſo as they reade no parte of it at all. As the whole in their opinion is too ſtrong a meate for their weake ſtomakes, ſo much of it they may right holeſomely receiue and brooke, as that which perteineth to pietie and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary knowledge of a chriſten man.<note place="margin">What par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes of the ſcriptures appertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to the people to knovve.</note> Wherein they would the examples of the olde holy fathers to be folowed. S. Auguſtine hath gathered together into to one booke, all that maketh for good lyfe out of the ſcriptures, which booke he intituled <hi>Speculu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> that is to ſaye, a myrrour or a looking glaſſe, as <hi>Poſsidonius</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth in his lyfe. S. Baſile hath ſet forth the like ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument almoſt in his fouerſcore moral rules pertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all together to good manners. S. Cyprian alſo hath done the like in his three bookes <hi>ad Quirinum.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3911:169"/> Such godly bookes they thinke to be very profitable for the ſimple people to reade. But how much and what partes of the ſcripture the common people may reade for their conforte and neceſſary inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and by whom the ſame may be tranſlated: it belongeth to the iudgement of the churche. Which church hath already condemned all the vulgare tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the Bible of late yeres, for that they be founde in ſundry places erroneous, and parciall in fauour of the hereſies, which the tranſlatours maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine. And it hath not onely in our tyme condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned theſe late tranſlations, but alſo hytherto neuer allowed thoſe fewe of olde tyme. I meane S. Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes tranſlation into the Dalmaticall tonge, if euer any ſuch was by him made, as to ſome it ſemeth a thing not ſufficiently proued: And that, which before S. Hierome Vlphilas an Arian biſhop made and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the nation of the Gothes, who firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented letters for them, and proponed the ſcriptures to them tranſlated into their owne tonge, and the better to bring his Ambaſſade to the Emperour Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens to good effecte, was perſuaded by the hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of Conſtantinople and of the courte there, to forſake the catholike faith, and to communicate with the Arians, making promiſe alſo to trauaile in bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the people of his countrie to the ſame ſecte, which at length he performed moſt wickedly.</p>
               <p>As for the church of this land of Britaine, the faith hath continewed in it thirten hundred yeres vntill now of late, without hauing the Bible tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the vulgare tonge, to be vſed of all in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:3911:169"/> Our lord graunt, we yelde no worſe ſoules to God now hauing the ſcriptures in our owne tonge, and talking ſo much of the goſpell, then our aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſters haue done before vs. This Iland ſayeth Beda (ſpeaking of the eſtate the church was in at his dayes) at this preſent, according to the number of bookes that Gods lawe was written in, doth ſerche and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe one and the ſelfe ſame knowlege of the high truth, and of the true highte, with the tonges of fiue nations, of the Engliſhe, the Britons, the Scottes, the Pightes, and the Latines, <hi>Quae meditatione ſcripturorum caeteris omnibus eſt facta co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munis.</hi> Which tonge of the Latines (ſayeth he) is for the ſtudie and meditation of the ſcriptures made common to all the other. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely as the Latine tonge was then commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to all the nations of this lande being of diſtincte languages, for the ſtudie of the ſcriptures, as Beda reporteth: ſo the ſame onely hath alwayes vntill our tyme, ben com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the cowntries and nations of the Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall or Weſt churche for the ſame purpoſe, and thereof it hath ben called the Latine churche.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to conclude, they that ſhewe them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues ſo earneſt and zelous for the tranſlation of the ſcriptures into all vulgare and barbarous tonges, it behoueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of wiſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſee, firſt, that no faultes be fownde in their tranſlations, as hytherto many haue ben fownde. And a ſmall faulte committed in the handling of Gods worde, is to be taken for a great crime. Nexte, that for as much as ſuch tranſlations perteine to all chriſten people, they be referred to the iudgement of the whole churche
<pb facs="tcp:3911:170"/> of euery language, and commended to the layetie by the wiſedom and auctoritie of the clergie hauing charge of their ſoules. Furthermore that there be ſome choiſe, exception, and limitation of tyme, place, and perſons, and alſo of partes of the ſcriptures, after the diſcrete ordinaunce of the Iewes. Amongeſt whom it was not laufull, that any man ſhuld reade certaine partes of the Bible, before he had fullfilled the tyme of the prieſtly miniſterie, which was the age of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeres,<note place="margin">Praefatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chielem.</note> as S.

Laſtly, that the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of the ſcriptures in the common language, be not commended to the people as a thing vtterly neceſſary to ſaluation, leaſt thereby they condemne ſo many churches, that hytherto haue lackt the ſame, and ſo many learned and godly fathers, that haue not procured it for their flockes, finally, all that haue gonne before vs, to whom in all vertue, innocencie, and holynes of lyfe, we are not to be compared. As for me, in as much as this matter is not yet deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the church, whether the common people ought to haue the ſcriptures in their owne tonge to reade and to heare, or no, I defyne nothing. As I eſteme greatly all godly and holeſome knowledge, and wiſhe the people had more of it, then they haue, with charitie and meekeneſſe: ſo I would, that theſe hote talkers of gods worde, had leſſe of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which maketh a man to ſwell, and to be proude in his owne conceite: and that they would depely weigh with them ſelues, whether they be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned within the lyſtes of the ſaying of S.

In figure or ſignification, he was offered in the ſacrifices made to God bothe in the tyme of the lawe of nature, and alſo in the tyme of the lawe written. And therefore Saint Iohn calleth Chriſt the lambe, which was killed from the begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world, meaning in figure. The ſacrifices of Abel,<note place="margin">Agnus oc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cilus eſt ab origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne mudi. Apoca. 13. Heb. 10. Lib. 6. ca. 5</note> Noe, and Abraham, and all thoſe of the people of Iſrael commaunded by the lawe of Moſes, figured and ſignified Chriſt. For which reſpecte chiefly, the law is reported of Saint Paul, to haue the ſhadowe of the good thinges to come. S. Auguſtine writing againſt Fauſtus the heretike, ſayeth: <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti veteris ſacrificia omnia multis &amp; varijs modis v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ſacrificium, cuius nunc memoriam celebramus, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficauerunt.</hi> All the ſacrifices of th'olde teſtament, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by many and ſundry waies this one ſacrifice, whoſe memorie we doo now celebrate.

               <p>Truly and with bloude ſhedding, Chriſt was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the Croſſe in his owne perſone. where of S.

               </p>
               <p>Sacramentally or in myſterie, Chriſt is offered vp to his father in the dayly ſacrifice of the churche vnder the forme of breade and wine, truly and in dede, not in reſpecte of the maner of offering, but in reſpecte of his very body and bloude really (that is in dede) preſent, as it hath ben ſufficiently proued here before.</p>
               <p>The two firſt maners of the offering of Chriſt, our aduerſaries acknowledge and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe. The third they denye vtterly. And ſo they robbe the churche of the greateſt treaſure it hath or may haue, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloude of our Sauiour Chriſt once offered vpon the croſſe with painefull ſuffering for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and now daily offered in the bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, in remembraunce. For which we haue ſo many proufes, as for no one point of our Chriſten religion moe. And herein I am more encombred with ſtore, then ſtraighted with lacke, and doubte more what I may leaue, then what I may take.</p>
               <p>Wherefor thinking it ſhall appeare to the wiſe more ſkylle to ſhewe diſcretion in the choiſe of places, rather then learning in recitall of number, thoug we are ouer peartely thereto prouoked by M. Iuelles vaunting and inſolent chalenge: I intend herein to be ſhorte, verely ſhorter, then ſo large a matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth: and to bring for proufe a fewe ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torities, I meane a fewe in reſpecte of the multitude
<pb facs="tcp:3911:175"/> that might be brought) as ought in euery mannes iudgement to be of great weight and eſtimation.</p>
               <p>The ſcripture it ſelfe miniſtring euident proufe for the oblation of Chriſt to his father by the prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes of the newe teſtament, in the Inſtitution of this holy Sacrament, in the figure of Melchiſedech, and in the prophecie of Malachie the prophete: the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torities of the fathers neded not to be alleged, were not the ſame ſcripture by the ouerthwarte and falſe interpretations of our aduerſaries wreſted and tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary ſenſe, to the horrible ſeducing of the vnlearned. For where as the holy Euangeliſtes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte, that <hi>Chriſt at his laſt ſupper tooke breade, gaue thankes, brake it, and ſayde, this is my body, wich is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for you:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luc. 22.</note> Againe, <hi>this is my bloude wich is ſhedde for you in remiſsion of ſynnes:</hi> By theſe wordes, being wordes of ſacrificing and offering, they ſhewe and ſet forth an oblation in acte and dede, though the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me it ſelfe of oblation or ſacrifice be not expreſſed. Albe it to ſome of excellent knowledge, <hi>datur</hi> here ſowndeth no leſſe, then <hi>offertur</hi> or <hi>immolatur,</hi> that is to ſaye, is offered or ſacrificed, ſpecially the additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>pro vobis,</hi> withall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſydered. For if Chriſt ſayde truly, (as he is truth it ſelfe, and guile was neuer fownde in his mowth) then was his body preſently geuen and for vs geuen, at the tyme he ſpake the wordes, that is, at his ſupper. For he ſayde, <hi>datur,</hi> is geuen, not <hi>dabitur,</hi> ſhall be geuen: And likewiſe was his bloude ſhedde in remiſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſynnes, at the tyme of that ſupper: for the texte hath <hi>funditur,</hi> is ſhedde. But the geuing of his body for vs, and the ſhedding of his
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:3911:175"/> bloud in remiſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſynnes, is an oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſame: ergo Chriſt offered his body and bloude at the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. And thus <hi>datur,</hi> ſignifieth here as much as <hi>offertur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this being true, that our lord offered him ſelfe vnto his father at his laſt ſupper, hauing geuen co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement to his Apoſtles to doo the ſame that he there dyd, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then he ordeined prieſtes of the newe teſtament, ſaying <hi>doo this in my remembraunce,</hi> as Clement doth plainely ſhewe. <hi>lib.</hi> 8. <hi>Apoſtolicarum co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitut. cap. vltimo:</hi> the ſame charge perteining no leſſe to the prieſtes that be now the ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles in this behalfe, then to the Apoſtles them ſelues: it doth right well appeare, how ſo euer M.

               <p>That Chriſt offered him ſelfe to his father in his laſt ſupper, and that prieſtes by thoſe wordes, <hi>Doo this in my remembraunce,</hi> haue not onely auctoritie, but alſo a ſpeciall commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to doo the ſame, and that the figure of Melchiſedech, and the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Malachie perteineth to this ſacrifice, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth proufe of the ſame: let vs ſee by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the fathers, what doctrine the Apoſtles haue lefte to the churche.</p>

And where as he ſayeth we haue ben taught to offer theſe ſacrifices to God, doubteles he meaneth by theſe wordes of Chriſt: <hi>Doo this in my remembraunce, this is my body, which is geuen for you: this is my bloud, which is ſhedde for you.</hi> Clement in his eight booke often cited, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the ſacrifice offered by the Apoſtles, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly addeth theſe wordes, <hi>ſecundum ipſius ordinatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> or, <hi>ipſo ordinante:</hi> Whereby he confeſſeth it to be Chriſtes owne ordinance.</p>

               <p>And at the ſame very inſtant of tyme, (which is here further to be added as a neceſſary point of Chriſten doctrine) whe muſt vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that Chriſt offered hem ſelfe in heauen inuiſibly (as concerning man) in the ſight of his hauenly father, and that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that tyme foreward that oblation of Chriſt in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen was neuer intermitted, but continewed allwaies for our attonement with God, and ſhall without ceaſing endure vntill the ende of the worlde. For as S. Paul ſayeth,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Ieſus hath not entred into temples made with handes, the ſamplers of the true temples, but into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſelfe, to appeare now to the cowntenance of God for vs.</hi> Now as this oblation and ſacrifice of Chriſt endureth in heauen continually, for as much as he is ryſen from the dead and aſcended in to heauen with

               <p>
                  <hi>Irenaeus</hi> receiued the ſame from Saint Iohn the Euangeliſt by Polycarpus Saint Iohns ſcoler. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth it with theſe wordes. <hi>Eum, qui ex creatura punis eſt, accepit, &amp; gratias egit, dicens,</hi>

De quo in duodecim prophetis Malachias ſic praeſignificauit,
<pb facs="tcp:3911:178"/> Non eſt mihi voluntas in vobis dicit Dominus exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Malac. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; munus non ſuſcipiam de manu veſtra.</hi> He tooke that which by creation is bread, and gaue thankes, ſaying, this is my body. And likewiſe the cuppe, full of that creature, which is here with vs, and confeſſed it to be his bloud, and thus taught the newe oblation of the newe teſtament, which the churche receiuing of the Apoſtles, doth offer to God through the whole worlde, whereof Malachie one of the twelue prophetes dyd prophecie thus. <hi>I haue no lyking in you, ſayeth our lord almighty, neither will I take ſacrifice of your handes: becauſe from the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the ſunne to the going downe of the ſame, my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me is glorified among the nations, and incenſe is offered to my name in euery place, and pure ſacrifice, for that my name is great among the nations.</hi> What can be vnderſtanded by this newe oblation of the newe teſtament other, then the oblation of that, which he ſayde to be his body, and confeſſed to be his bloude. And if he had offered bread and wine onely, or the figure of his body and bloud in bread and wine, it had ben no newe oblation. for ſuch had ben made by <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> long before. Neither can the prophecie of Malachie be vnderſtanded of the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt vpon the croſſe, for as much as that was done but at one tyme onely, and in one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine place of the world, in Golgoltha a place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the gates of Ieruſalem neare to the walles of that citie. Concerning the ſacrifice of a contrite and an humbled heart, and all other Sacrifices of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:3911:178"/> our deuotion, that be mere ſpirituall, they can not be called the newe oblation of the Newe teſtament, for as much as they were done as well in the olde teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as in the newe, neither be they all together pure. Wherefore this place of Irenaeus, and alſo the prophecie of Malachie, wherewith it is confirmed, muſt nedes be referred to the ſacrifice and oblation of the body and bloud of Chriſt dayly throughout the whole world offered to God in the Maſſe, which is the externall Sacrifice of the churche and proper to the newe teſtament: which, as Irenaeus ſayeth, the church receiued of the Apoſtles, and the Apoſtles of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now let vs heare what S. Cyprian hath written to this purpoſe. Becauſe his workes be common,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. epiſt. 3.</note> to be ſhorter, I will rehearſe his wordes in Engliſh. If in the Sacrifice, which is Chriſt, none but Chriſt is to be folowed, ſoothly it behoueth vs to obey and doo that, which Chriſt dyd, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to be done. For if Ieſus Chriſt our lord and God, very he him ſelfe be the high prieſt of God the father, and him ſelfe firſt offered ſacrifice to God the father, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the ſame to be done in his reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce: verely that prieſt doth occupie the office of Chriſt truly, who doth by imitation the ſame thing that Chriſt dyd. And then he offereth to God the father in the church a true and a perfite ſacrifice, if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynne to offer, right ſo as he ſeeth Chriſt him ſelfe to haue offered. This farre S. Cyprian. How can this Article be auouched in more plaine wordes? he ſayeth that Chriſt offered him ſelfe to his father in his
<pb facs="tcp:3911:179"/> ſupper, and likewiſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded vs to doo the ſame.</p>
               <p>Here we haue proued, that it is lawfull, and hath alwaies from the begynning of the newe t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Our aduerſaries crake much of the ſealing vp of their newe doctrine with the bloud of ſuch and ſuch, who be writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the booke of lyes, not in the booke of lyfe, whom they will nedes to be called martyrs. Verely if thoſe Moonkes and freres, Apoſtates and renegates, wedded to wiues, or rather (to vſe their owne terme) yoked to ſiſters, be true martyrs: then muſt our newe Goſpellers pull theſe holy fathers, and many thouſandes mo, out of heauen. For certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely the faith, in defence of which either ſorte dyed, is vtterly contrary. The worſt that I wiſhe to them, is, that God geue them eyes to ſee, and eares to heare, and that he ſhut not vp their hartes, ſo as they ſee not the light here, vntill they be throwen awaye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the owtward darkenes,<note place="margin">Matt. 15.</note> where ſhall be weeping and grynting of teeth.</p>

And ſo it is a ſacrifice in very dede propitiatorie, not for our acte or worke, but for his owne worke already done and accepted. To this onely we muſt aſcribe remiſsion and remouing of our ſynnes.</p>
               <p>If the terme Maſſe be taken for the acte of the prieſt, in reſpecte of any his onely doing, it is not able to remoue ſynne. For ſo we ſhuld make the prieſt gods peere, and his acte equall with the paſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt, as our aduerſaries doo vniuſtly ſclaunder vs. Yet hath the Maſſe vertue and effecte in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and is acceptable to god, by reaſon of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the ſacrifice, which in the Maſſe is done by the offerer, without reſpect had to Chriſtes inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, euen for the faithfull prayer and deuotion of the partie that offereth, which the ſcoole doctours terme <hi>ex opere operantis.</hi> For then the oblation ſemeth to be moſt acceptable to god, when it is offered by ſome that is acceptable. Now the partie that offereth is of two ſortes. The one offereth immediatly and perſonally. the other offereth mediatly, or by meane of an other, and principally. The firſt is the prieſt that conſecrateth, offereth and receiueth the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who ſo doth theſe thinges in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet by gods auctoritie, as none other in ſo offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:3911:185"/> is concurrent with him. The partie that offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth mediately or by meane of an other and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, is the churche militant, in whoſe perſon the prieſt offereth, and whoſe miniſter he is in offering. For this is the Sacrifice of the whole churche. The firſt partie that offereth, is not alwayes acceptable to God, neither alwaies pleaſeth him, becauſe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes he is a ſynner. The ſecond partie that offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, is euermore acceptable to God, becauſe the churche is alwayes holy, beloued, and the onely ſpooſe of Chriſt. And in this reſpecte the Maſſe is an acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable ſeruice to god, <hi>ex opere operantis,</hi> and is not without cauſe and reaſon called a ſacrifice propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, not for that it deſerueth mercie at gods hand of it ſelfe, as Chriſt doth, who onely is in that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall and ſpeciall ſorte a ſacrifice propitiatorie: but for that it moueth god to geue mercie and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſynne already deſerued by Chriſt. In this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of a ſacrifice propitiatorie, we may put prayer, a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ttite harte, almoſe, forgeuing of our neighbour, etc. This may eaſely be proued by the holy fathers.</p>

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:3911:186"/> that other, <hi>rem terrenam,</hi> the earthly thing. Taken the firſt waie, no Chriſten man euer honoured it with the name of lord and God. For that were plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Idolatrie, to attribute the name of the Creator, to the creature. But taken in the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſignification, it hath alwayes of Chriſten people and of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned fathers of the churche, ben called by the name of lord and God. And of right ſo ought it to be, for elles were it impietie and a denyall of God, not to call Chriſt the ſonne of God, by the name of lord and God, who is not onely in truth of fleſhe and bloud in the Sacrament, after which maner he is there <hi>ex vi Sacramenti,</hi> but alſo for the inſeparable coniunction of bothe natures in vnitie of perſon, <hi>ex neceſſaria concomitantia,</hi> whole Chriſt, God and man. That the holy fathers called the Sacrament taken in this ſenſe, lord and God, I might proue it by many places, the rehearſall of a fewe may ſerue for many. Origen in an homilie ſpeaking reuerently of this bleſſed Sacrament, ſayeth,<note place="margin">In diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fos Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelij lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos. ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. 5.</note> that when a man receiueth it, our lord entreth vnder his rooffe, and exhorteth him that ſhall receiue it, to humble him ſelfe and to ſaye vnto it: <hi>Domine non ſum dignus vt intres ſub te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum meum. Lord I am not worthy that thou enter vnder my rooffe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>S. Cyprian <hi>in Sermone de lapſis,</hi> telleth, how a man, who had denyed God in tyme of perſecution, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing notwithſtanding (the ſacrifice by the prieſt done) priuely with others receiued the Sacrament, not being able to eate it nor to handle it, opening his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, fownde that he bare aſſhes. Where he addeth
<pb facs="tcp:3911:187"/> theſe wordes. <hi>Documento vnius oſtenſum eſt, dominum recedere, cum negatur.</hi> By this example of one man it is ſhewed, that our lord departeth awaie, when he is denyed. The ſame S. Cyprian in th'expoſition of the <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> declaring the fourth petition of it, <hi>Geue vs thys daye our daily bread:</hi> vnderſtandeth it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine a deſyre of the holy communion in this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament, and ſayeth. <hi>Ideo panem noſtrum, id eſt, Christum dari nobis quotidie petimus, vt qui in Chriſto manemus &amp; viuimus, à ſanctificatione &amp; corpore eius non recedamus.</hi> Therefore we aſke our daily bread, that is to ſaye, Chriſt, to be geuen vnto vs, that we which abyde and lyue in Chriſt, depart not from the ſtate of holynes, and communion of his bodye. Here S. Cyprian calleth the Sacrament Chriſt, as he is in dede there preſent really, ſo as in the place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged before he calleth it lord. And I wene our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries will imbarre the Sacrament of the name of Chriſt, no leſſe then of the name of lord or God.</p>
               <p>Onleſſe they make leſſe of Chriſt, then of lord and God. Verely this holy martyr acknowlegeth this ſacrament not for lord and Chriſt onely, but alſo for God, by theſe wordes in his ſermon <hi>de coena Domini. Sicut in perſona Chriſti humanitas videbatur, &amp; latebat diuinitas, ita ſacramento viſibili ineffabiliter diuina ſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fudit eſſentia.</hi> As in the perſon of Chriſt, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode was ſene, and the godhed was hydden, ſo the diuine eſſence (or ſubſtaunce of God) hath infuſed it ſelfe into the viſible ſacrament vnſpeakeably.</p>

                  <note place="margin">In Ioan. lib. 4. cap. 15.</note>Cyrillus accompteth the ſacrament for Chriſt, and God the word, and for God, in this ſaying. <hi>Qui car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Chriſti manducat, vitam habet aeternam.

               <p>No man more expreſſely calleth the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by the name of God, then S.

               <p>They are meruelous thinges brethren, that be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of this Sacrament. faith is neceſſarie, knowledge of reaſon is (here) ſuperfluous.

               <p>Here let our aduerſaries touching this Article, conſyder and weigh with them ſelues, whether they be Lutheranes, Zuinglianes, or Geneuians, what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh they can make of theſe wordes vſed by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and applyed to the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alleaged. <hi>Dominus, Chriſtus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Diuina eſſentia, Deus, Seipſum, Verbum Dei, Ego, Verbum foenum factum, Deum ſuum.</hi> The number of the like places that might be alleaged to this purpoſe, be in maner infinite.

Verely I thinke, they were taught the truth of this matter ſimply and plainely, yet ſo as nothing was hydden from them, that in thoſe quiet tymes, (quiet I meane touching this point

Yet this matter hath not ſo much ben taught in open audience of the people, as debated priuatly betwen learned men in ſcooles, and ſo of them ſet forth in their priuate writinges. Wherein if ſome perhappes through con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of wittes haue ben either ouer curiouſe, or ouer bolde, and haue ouerſhotte the marke, or not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed the point they haue taken in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to treate of, or through ignoraunce, or fauour of a parte, haue in ſome thing ſwarued from reaſon, or that meaning which holy churche holdeth it is great vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteſie to laye that to our charge, to abuſe their ouerſightes to our diſcredite, and to reproue the whole churche for the inſufficiencie of a fewe.</p>
               <p>Now concerning this Article, whether we are able to auouche it by ſuch authorities as M. Iuell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, or no, it ſhall not greatly force. The cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite of the catholike faith dependeth not of olde proufes of a fewe newe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſed pointes, that ben of leſſe importaunce. As for the people, they
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:3911:190"/> were taught the truth plainely, when no heretike had aſſaulted their faith craftely.<note place="margin">The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che.</note> The doctrine of the churche is this. The body of Chriſt after due conſecration remayneth ſo long in the Sacrament, as the Sacrament endureth. The Sacrament endureth ſo long as the formes of breade and wine continewe. Thoſe formes continewe in their integritie, vntill the other accidentes be corrupted ad periſhe. As if the colour, weight, ſauour, taſte, ſmell, and other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of bread and wine be corrupted and quite al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, then is the forme alſo of the ſame annichila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and vndone. And to ſpeake of this more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, ſith that the ſubſtance of bread and wine is tourned into the ſubſtance of the body and bloud of Chriſt, as the ſcriptures, auncient doctours, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequent of truth, and determination of holy churche leadeth vs to beleue: if ſuch chaunge of the accidentes be made, which ſhuld not haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſed to the corruption of bread and wine, in caſe of their remaindre: for ſuch a chaunge the body and bloud of Chriſt ceaſeth not to be in this Sacrament, whether the chaunge be in qualitie, as if the colour, ſauour, and ſmell of bread and wine be a litle alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or in quantitie, as if thereof diuiſion be made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch portions, in which the nature of bread and wine might be reſerued. But if there be made ſo great a chaunge, as the nature of bread and wine ſhuld be corrupted, if they were preſent: then the body and bloud of Chriſt doo not remaine in this Sacrament, as when the colour and ſauour and other qualities of bread and wine are ſo farre chaunged, as
<pb facs="tcp:3911:191"/> the nature of bread and wine might not bear it: or on the qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tities ſyde, as if the bread be ſo ſmall cro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into duſt, and the wine diſperſed into ſo ſmall portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as their formes remaine no lenger the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no more the body and bloud in this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Thus the body and bloud of Chriſt remayneth in this ſacrament, ſo long as the formes of bread and wine remaine. And when they faile and ceaſe to be any more, then alſo ceaſeth the body and bloud of Chriſt to be in the Sacrament. For there muſt be a conuenience and reſemblaunce betwen the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and the thinges whereof they be ſacraments, which done awaie and loſte at the corruption of the formes and accidents, the ſacraments alſo be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done and periſhe, and conſequently the inward thing and the heauenly thing in them conteined, leaueth to be in them.</p>

Some others be through the maner of your vtterance peruerted, and in termes drawen from the ſenſe they haue ben vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in by the church.

            <p>Now this being ſo, what you mynde to doo, I knowe not, what you ought to doo, I knowe right well.

This may you doo, by forſaking that, which perhappes ſemeth to you truth, and is not: that, which ſemeth to you learning, and is but a flooriſhe or verniſhe of learnig: that which ſemeth to you cleare light, and is profounde darknes, and by retourning to the church, where concerning the faith of a chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man, is all truth, and no deceite, right learning,<note place="margin">Ioan. 1.</note> and the very light, euen that, which lightneth euery man coming into this worlde, which

            <p>O that you would once mynde this ſeriouſly M. Iuell.

I would gladly powre out all together, to helpe you to atteine that felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. But ô lord what lettes ſee I, whereby you are kepte from that good! Shame, welth of your eſtate, your worldly acquaintance, beſyde many others. But Syr, touching ſhame, which alwayes irketh thoſe, that be of any generoſitie of nature, if you call your better philoſophie to counſell, you ſhall be taught, not to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pte it ſhamefull, to forſake errour for loue of truth, but rather willfully to dwell in errour, after that it is plainely detected. As for the welth of your eſtate, which ſome aſſure you of, ſo long as you maineteine that parte: I can not iudge ſo euill of you, but that you thinke, how fickle and fraile theſe worldly thinges bee, and how litle to be eſtemed, in reſpecte of the heauenly eſtate, which remaineth to the obedient children of the church, as the contrarie to the rebelles, Apoſtates, and renegates. Touching your acquaintance, what ſhall the familiaritie of a fewe deceiued perſons ſtaye you from that felicitie, which you ſhall acheue with the loue and frendſhip of all good men, of whoſe good opinion onely ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth fame and renome,<note place="margin">Luc. 15.</note> and alſo with the reioiſing of the Angels in heauen?</p>
            <p>This your happy chaunge, the better and wiſer

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall they iudge that inconſtancie, where is no chaunge in will, but onely in vnderſtanding. Where the will remaining one, alwayes bent to the glorie of God, the deceiued vnderſtanding is by better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction corrected and righted: there is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie to be noted, but amendment to be prayſed. Neither ſhall you in this godly enterpriſe be alone. Many both of olde tyme, and of our dayes, haue gone this waye, and haue broken the yſe before you. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius of Caeſarea in Palaeſtina, Beryllus of Boſtra in Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia, and Theodoritus of Cyrus in Perſie:</hi> who forſooke haynouſe hereſies againſt Chriſt, and by grace retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the catholike faith againe.

            <p>Thus hauing called to my mynde the conſyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, that are like to withholde you from yelding to the catholike faith, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> retourning to the church, and from performing your promiſe: I fynde no ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ſo ſtrong, to kepe you faſt in the chayer of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence, which this long tyme you haue ſitten in: that through Gods grace working humilitie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall of your ſelfe in your hart, whereof I ſpake in my preface, you ſhuld not eaſely looſe and be in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, where you might clearly ſee the light ſpredde abroad ouer the whole Church, and eſpie the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knes of the particuler ſectes of your newe goſpell, which you lyued in before.</p>
            <pb n="191" facs="tcp:3911:198"/>
            <p>But all this notwithſtanding, peraduenture your hart ſerueth you to ſtande ſtowtly according to the purport of your chalenge, in the defence of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine you haue profeſſed, and for which you haue obteined a biſhoprike, thinking great ſkorne, to be remoued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame, by any ſuch meanes, as theſe to you may ſeme. And now perhappes you enter into meditation with your ſelfe and confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with your brethren, to frame an anſwere to this treatiſe, and by contrary writing to fortifie your negatiues. Well may you ſo doo. But to what purpoſe, I praye you? Well may you make a ſmoke and a ſmooder, to darken the light for a tyme, as men of warre are wont to doo, to worke a feate ſecretly againſt their enemies. But that can not long continewe. The ſmoke will ſone vaniſhe awaye, the light of the truth will efte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones appeare. Well may you ſhutte the light out of a fewe houſes, by cloſing dores and windowes, but to kepe awaye the bright ſunne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that great Citie which is ſet on high vpon a hill, doo what ye can,<note place="margin">Matt. 5.</note> therein all your trauaill, your deuiſes and endeuours, ſhall be vaine and fruſtrate.</p>
            <p>As iron by ſcowring is not onely not conſumed, but kepte fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ruſte and canker, and is made brighter: ſo the church by the armures and hoſtilitie of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes is not wounded, but through occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſtyrred to defence, and made inuincible. When it is opreſſed, then it ryſeth, when it is inuaded, then it ouercometh. When by the aduerſaries obiections it is chekte and controlled, then it is acquitted and preuaileth. Wherefore talke, preache, and write againſt the doctrine of the church whiles ye will, ye

All the reward ye ſhall wynne hereby, is the vaine fauour of a fewe light and vnſtable perſons by you deceiued. Whom the blaſtes of your mutable doctrine, ſhall moue and blowe awaye from Gods floore the church,<note place="margin">Matt. 3.</note> like chaffe, the good and conſtant people remaining ſtill, like weighty and ſownde wheate.</p>
            <p>The argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes and reaſons you ſhall make againſt the doctrine of the church, may happely perſuade ſome of the worldly wiſe, who be fooles in Gods iudgement, as the reaſons of them, that haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended infamouſe matters,<note place="margin">Phauori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.

Which by the authours hath ben done one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for an exerciſe of wittes, and rather to the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, then corrupting of the Readers, Would God of all the writinges of your ſect againſt the catholike faith, which be no leſſe beſyde reaſon and truth, the intent were no worſe, the danger enſuing no greater. And as for commendation of thoſe vnſemely and vnworthy thinges, thoſe Rhetoricians haue not brought good and true reaſons, but onely a probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of talke: right ſo for confirmation of your nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:3911:199"/> diuinitie, and of many newe ſtraunge and falſe doctrines, you haue no ſuer proufes, but ſhadowes, colours, and ſhewes onely, that perhappes may daſell bleare eyes, and deceiue the vnlearned: but the learned wiſe, and by any wayes godly wiſe, will ſone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the ſame, For they be aſſured, how probably ſo euer you teach or write, that the church allwayes aſsiſted and prompted by the holy Ghoſte the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of truth, in pointes of faith erreth not, and that againſt truth allready by the ſame ſpirite in the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall church taught and receiued, no truth can be alleaged.</p>
            <p>As he is very ſimple, who, being borne in hande by a Sophiſter, and driuen by force of ſophiſticall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to graunt, that he hath hornes, thinketh ſo in dede, and therfore putteth his hande to his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed: So who ſo euer through your teaching fall from the catholike Church into the errours of our tyme, from the ſtreightnes of Chriſtian lyfe, into the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall libertie of this newe goſpell, from deuotion into the inſenſibilitie which we ſee the people to lyue in, from the feare of God, to the deſperat contempte of all vertue and goodnes: hereby they ſhewe them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to be ſuch, as haue vnſtable hartes, which be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ouer to the luſtes of their fleſhe, which haue no delite ne feeling of God, which like Turkes and Epicures ſeeking onely for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this world, haue no regard of the lyfe to come. But the godly ſorte, whoſe hartes be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with grace, who pant and labour to lyue after the ſpirite, continually mortifying their fleſhe, whoſe

            <p>Wherefore M. Iuell ſeing we haue performed that, which you haue ouer boldly ſayde, we were not able to doo: ſeing for proufe of theſe Arcicles we haue brought more, then you bare your hearers in hande, we had to bring: ſeing you perceiue your ſelfe herein to haue done more, then ſtandeth with lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, modeſtie, or good aduiſe: ſeing in caſe of any one clauſe or ſentence for our parte brought, you haue with ſo many proteſtations promyſed to yelde and to ſubſcribe vnto vs: ſeing by performing your promiſe, you may do ſo much good to the people and to your ſelfe: ſeing nothing can be iuſtly allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for keping of you from ſatisfying your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and retourning to the church againe: ſeing ſo great reſpectes both of temporall and of heauenly prefermentes inuite you and call you from partes and ſectes, where you remayne with moſt certaine danger of your ſoule, to the ſafe porte of Chriſtes church: ſeing by ſo dooing, you ſhuld not doo that which were ſingular, but common to you with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, men of right good fame and eſtimation: finally ſeing if you ſhall, as allwayes for the moſt parte heretikes haue done, continew in the profeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your vntrue doctrine, and trauaill in ſetting forth erroneouſe treatiſes for defence of the ſame, you ſhall gaigne thankes of no other, but of the lighteſt and worſt ſorte of the people, and perſuade none but ſuch as be of that marke: we truſt you will vpon mature
